GitHub can display a description of the current folder if there is a file called README.xxx in the folder.
If .xxx is .txt, the description will be plain: no colour; all letters are of the same font and size.
If .xxx is .md, the README will be interpreted as a Markdown file. You can get a taste for what Markdown looks like below.
