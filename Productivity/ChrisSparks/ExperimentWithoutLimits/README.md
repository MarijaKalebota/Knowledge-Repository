# Experiment Without Limit

Chapters stand on their own. Feel free to skip.  
Invest. You only get what you put in.  

## Chapter 1: Setting Goals

### Goal Generation

Generate them through stories, values or taking the outside view.  
Think big.  
Use one of three types of prompts.  

Write a life story.  
Shift your thinking from happiness to what is most meaningful.  

Prioritize your values.  
How do you want to spend your days?  

Be objective.  
How can you make the most in your current situation and with your current knowledge and skills?  

### Goal Selection

The lost value of an unselected goal when an alternative goal is selected.

### Goal Framing

`SMART` goal:
* Specific: pinpoint what you want and how to achieve it
* Measurable: create measurements to track your progress and illuminate opportunities to improve
* Actionable: an input, an action under your control (not: "4% body fat", "get rich"; these are outcomes)
* Rewarding: should be challenging and meaningful to stay the course
* Time-Based: has a clear endpoint or deadline which creates urgency

Think of your life as an experiment and your goals as hypotheses.  
Commit for a month and then review them.  
How can you improve? Do you still think a goal is worth pursuing?  

Experiment:
* STEP 1: What is a SMART goal that could improve your life?
* STEP 2: What are the hypotheses that need to be tested?
* STEP 3: Which hypothesis is critical to the experiment's success? What is the result necessary to support completion on this goal?
* STEP 4: How will you quickly test this hypothesis? How will you adjust if your test does not have the desired result?

## Chapter 2: Designing Systems

Develop systems to drive lasting behavioral changes.  
Three principals:
* bottlenecks
* feedback loops
* leverage

### Bottleneck

Steps:
* where would you like to accelerate progress?
* write down constraints for five minutes
* choose the bottleneck constraint
* write down actions to reduce the constraint for five minutes
* pick an action and track your progress towards

### Feedback Loop

Systems where outputs effect the inputs.  

Balancing feedback loops maintain the status quo.  
Reinforcing feedback loops amply behavior.  
Improvement loop is made of planning, experimenting and reflecting.  
Increase the frequency of measurement and experimentation.  

Build an improvement loop:
* PLAN
    * Goal:
        * Select a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Rewarding, Time-based) for which you want a feedback loop. How will you know when you have achieved your goal?
    * Habit:
        * What input action will lead you to your goal?
    * Measure:
        * How will you track your efforts to ensure they are leading to your desired results?

* EXPERIMENT
    * Measure:
        * How will you make sure that you are regularly tracking progress?
    * Balancing Loop:
        * What can you put in place to improve your consistency? What can you put in place to prevent you from getting off track?
    * Reinforcing Loop:
        * What could help you continually raise the bar for yourself?

* REFLECT
    * Measure:
        * When will you have enough data to know how to proceed next?
    * Iterate:
        * How can you improve upon this plan for next time?

### Leverage

Ability to return maximum results per unit of effort.  
Pareto's principle or the 80/20 rule illustrates leverage perfectly.  

Greatest points of leverage:
* change goals and values, realign the system
* build self-organizing systems that improve over time
* improve information flow, take better measurements
* install feedback loops
* shorten the loop, measure and respond more quickly

## Chapter 3: Building Habits

Discipline is a collection of strong habits.  

### Upstream Effects

If you repeat a habit, it becomes more ingrained.  
Actions taken to change your habits precede the habit change.  

### Habit Loop

Habit loop is made up of:
* Triggers set the habit in motion.
    * Triggers are contextual details which your brain has previously associated with a habit.
* Behaviors are the actual actions performed as part of the habit.
* Rewards reinforce a habit.
    * Rewards strengthen the link between a trigger and the associated habit behavior.

### Habit Triggers

Triggers make the habit action happen.

To create a new habit, start by writing it out in the form of an algorithm: “IF [Trigger], THEN [Behavior]”.

The five categories of Triggers are:
* Preceding events
* Time of day
* Location
* Emotional state
* Other people

The best triggers have the following characteristics:
* Consistent: Happens every single day with a reliable frequency.
    * After getting ready for work -> After getting dressed
* Automatic: Effortless to notice when it occurs.
    * At 9:30 AM -> When my 9:30 AM alarm goes off
* Unavoidable: Impossible to find a way around it.
    * Walking past the gym -> Leaving my apartment

Break bad habits by reducing the frequency of triggers since: no trigger == no habit. Make triggers less specific, less consistent, less automatic, and more avoidable.

### Habit Behaviours

Behavior Design:
* Eliminate unnecessary steps.
    * Minimize the number of action steps necessary to complete your habit.
        * Have your running clothes already on when it is time to run.
* Always auto opt-in.
    * Make any decisions needed to begin a habit in advance.
        * Have your running distance and route chosen in advance.
* Reduce activation energy.
    * Make starting your habit so easy that you can’t say no. Think two minutes or less.
        * Give yourself permission to just run around the block.
* Eliminate excuses.
    * Remove any source of friction which might cause you to skip your habit.
        * Own running clothes and shoes that you love.
        * Block off time for running on your calendar.

### Habit Rewards

Rewards reinforce the association between a trigger and a behavior through repetition.  
The more immediate the reward, the stronger the habit reinforcement.  

Examples of extrinsic rewards:
- Physiological
    - Have a snack, drink tea, take a short break, go for a walk
- Psychological
    - Check into habit app, cross off a day on calendar
- Social
    - Text accountability partner, talk to a friend, share to social media
- Physical
    - Do a fist pump, victory dance, smile
- Verbal
    - Praise yourself, say a phrase like “way to go!”, sing a song
- Play a favorite song or sound that makes you feel good

Examples of intrinsic rewards:
- Physical Feeling
    - How does your body feel differently from before?
- Mental Feeling
    - Are you more calm, focused, or inspired?
- Satisfaction
    - How do you feel about yourself?
- Pleasure
    - What was enjoyable today?
- Subjective Experience
    - What felt different from the last time?

Structure habits in such a way that you position your preexisting rewards immediately after your most fragile habits.

To add accountability to your habits, try sharing your progress online, telling friends about your habit commitment, or making a bet.

Consistent measurement creates the tight feedback loops necessary for accelerated progress. Identify which conditions correlated with habit completion and then always recreate those conditions in the future.

### Keystone Habits

Keystone habits are the scaffolding of your productivity practice. Installing a keystone habit starts a chain reaction, creating a cascade of positive behaviors.

Identifying Keystone Habits:
* What habits will make the rest of my day go better?
* What habits will make other habits easier or more likely to
happen?
* What habits will cause me to view myself in a more positive light?

When starting a new habit, maximize your chances by following
these best practices:
* Focus on building just one new habit at a time.
* Set the initial bar for success so low you can’t say no. Think two minutes or less.
* Have a specific and consistent location and time of day blocked off for your habit.
* Have a plan ready for when you are unable to complete your habit at the usual time or place.
* Commit to completing the habit every single day for an entire month.
