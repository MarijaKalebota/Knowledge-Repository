## Wealth

Start or join a startup.  
Startups involve technology.  
Startups compress working life into a few years.  
Working fast pays well in technology.  

If you want to earn a million, you need to endure a million pains.  

Wealth != Money
Wealth is what people want.  
Money moves wealth.  

Grow the pie by creating wealth.  

The biggest remaining craftsmen groups are computer programmers.  

Scientist donate their work.  
By writing open source software, programmers donate their work.  

In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people's.  
A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.  

The single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work.  
You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much?  

To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage:
* performance can be measured
* decisions you make have a big effect
A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.  

Smallness = Measurement
If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual employees, you can get close by measuring the value of the work done by small groups, a startup.  
That's the real point of startups: you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more.  

Technology = Leverage
Technology is a technique. Its value is multiplied by all the people who use it. A fishing rod, rather than the fish. That's the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut hair one customer at a time. Whereas if you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution. That's leverage.

Run upstairs. Solve the difficult problem that your competition is even slower at solving.  
Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: barriers to entry.  

Catches:
* your competitiors decide how hard you have to work; you don't get to make that decision
* startups are a all-or-nothing proposition
* selling a startup in an early stage is hard

Get users. They are proof you created what people want, wealth.  
It is the metric acquirers care about.  
Get version v1.0 out as soon as you can. Optimize later.  

If you want to create wealth then you should be skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. 
That is where your idea of what's valuable is least likely to coincide with other people's.
