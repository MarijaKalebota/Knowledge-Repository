Do you recognize:
* Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.
* Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.
* Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.
* Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.
* Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.
* Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.
* People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.
