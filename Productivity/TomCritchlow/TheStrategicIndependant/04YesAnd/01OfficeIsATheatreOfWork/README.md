## [Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/18/yes-and/)

Did you ever experience:
* Working on a detailed presentation only for the meeting to get derailed 5 slides in.
* Ritually showing our face at our desks at the appropriate time to signal that we’re working.
* Attending weekly status meetings to create the performance of keeping things moving.
* Brainstorm sessions to create the illusion of inclusive creativity.
* Workshops with scripted games and exercises and sticky notes to ensure everyone has a good time.
* Jealousy of colleagues who don’t do good work but excel at presenting their work.
* People who talk about their work getting promoted more than those that don’t.

Silent success, work that speaks for itself is a myth!  
Do the opposite: performance of the work is work!  
This is because companies are social not rational systems.  

Examples of performance of work:
* Presentations of your work
* Hallway chats
* 1:1 conversations to build alignment
* Crafting the wrapper and positioning of your work
* Changing the language of your work to match others
* Including wider contexts of the organization, the industry and the market in your work
* Reformatting your presentations to fit other team’s strategies

### Being present, public and acting with voice

In the theater of work you must be public and have a voice.  
Laboring humans are fungible and never make history.  

More examples:
* Read [Stevey's Google Platforms Rant](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611) and observe the strong, carefree and precise their opinions
* Ask Questions in public squares; take positions and have an opinion

### Enter Stage Left: The Consultant

Full time employees can script and rehearse their performance. Consultants must improvise or get kicked out.  

### The Theatre of Work is an Improv Theatre

Being a consultants has its drawbacks:
* you can't polish your performance because you don't have the time, so prototype and improvise instead
* you won't be included in all the info bursts, so leave room for new contexts to emerge
* you must make your presentations present unfinished work that has room for improvement, else you won't get any feedback because your work look s already finished

People at an executive, decision making, level react hand play off of cues to make the in moment decisions.  

You must be present in the room and study the people as much as the organization.  

### The Serendipity-Deficit of Consultants & Manufacturing Improv Sessions

Don't just wait for the opportunity to present your ideas in the official channel.  

Create spontaneous encounters and state your ideas informally, in the hallway, on break, many times before hoping it will officially take hold.  

Intercepting the CEO at the door is not an unheard of strategy.  

### How to think on your feet without bullshitting

You need to strike a balance between providing answers and deflecting questions for later.  

People will want to know:
* How much do you know?
* How much are you going to improve?  

Avoid saying half-truths and made up opinions by:
* You must be able to draw a diagram explaining the core business revenue and profit function at a medium-high specificity level.
* Study and adopt the language of the client's business.
* Speak clearly and within your limits. Ask for clarification and don't pretend you understand if you don't.
* Ask questions about company history, about alternative approaches, about failed previous ideas.
* It is much easier to defend your ideas then your data points.
* When you get challenged your data is wrong, challenge them to prove your counter-point is wrong.
* Ground conversations in reality and business outcomes, not intellectual debates.  
* Read widely - analogy is the core of cognition. Source ideas from different industries as clients won't have that internally.

Being critical is easier, but a wrong approach! Be optimistic!
