## [Optimism as an Operating System](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/11/19/optimism-operating-system/)

Embrace the strengths of the organization first, before criticizing and finding all the problems.  
You need to make people like having you around and a pleasure to work with.  

### The Critical Path

Downplay the problem rather then make it into a crisis.  

### Back-stage in the Theatre of Work

You must participate in breakroom chats, humor and conversations to prevent becoming an outsider.  

You should aim for the middle when:
* showing up in the back-room, not often, not too rarely
* join the humor, but don't be too edgy
* be careful about aiming your humor
* observe where the humor spills into real frustration

### Positivity & Long Term Retainers

Sometimes, being excited, positive and enthusiastic is enough.  
These are precursors for real change.  

### On client frustration and the word "justâ€¦"

What seemed like a problem might be because of the client's strength.  
Hunt for systems, not problems. A change will effect the whole system.  

### Enduring Clients

"We are here to make our clients succeed as companies and, generally by extension, as people too."  

Professional and personal boundaries are often blurred. Embrace it and make friends for they are your greatest asset.
