The following is a bullet point summary of the notes.  

### Chapter 1 - The Office is a Theatre for Work

* Silent success, work that speaks for itself, is a myth! Do the opposite: performance of the work is work!  
* In the theater of work you must be public and have a voice. Laboring humans are fungible and never make history.
* You must be present in the room and study the people as much as the organization.  
* Create spontaneous encounters and state your ideas informally, in the hallway, on break, many times before hoping it will officially take hold.  
* You need to strike a balance between providing answers and deflecting questions for later.  

### Chapter 2 - Optimism as an Operating System

* Embrace the strengths of the organization first, before criticizing and finding all the problems. You need to make people like having you around and a pleasure to work with.  
* Downplay the problem rather then make it into a crisis.  
* You must participate in breakroom chats, humor and conversations to prevent becoming an outsider. Use middle of the road humor.  
* Sometimes, being excited, positive and enthusiastic is enough. These are precursors for real change.  
* What seemed like a problem might be because of the client's strength. Hunt for systems, not problems. A change will effect the whole system.
* Professional and personal boundaries are often blurred. Embrace it and make friends for they are your greatest asset.
