## [Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never Ignore a Recruiter](https://index.medium.com/career-advice-nobody-gave-me-never-ignore-a-recruiter-4474eac9556)

Recruiters:
* frustrating
* annoying
* great career resource
* overwhelming
* produce volume of messages
* bad at targeting
* impersonal
* don't know you
* don't care about you
* relentless
* spammy
* one in a hundred can double your salary

Discomfort around responding to recruiters:
* If you respond, does that mean you're being disloyal to your current employer?
* If you respond when you're not looking does it make you dishonest?
* If you respond to a spam-cruiter that only sees you as a paycheque are you just rewarding bad behaviour?

However:
* Who better to be completely honest with about what you want from your career? 
* Who else has real and direct insight into how much money any given role pays?
It can be frustrating and annoying.
* What better time to enter a negotiation than when you perfectly happy to walk away if you don't get what you want?
* The best time to talk to a recruiter is when you are not looking for a job.

If the message comes in with:
* a company name
* job description
* compensation budget
... then skip to "So I'm a dog who caught the car. Now what do I do?"

### The Auto Response Template

```
Thanks so much for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. As a software engineer I'm sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn. It is a wonderful position of privilege to be in and I'm thankful for it.

It does however mean that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to level set around the level of seniority that you're looking for.

Can you send along the company name, a job description and total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to?

While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out!
 
I look forward to hearing from you.

### So I'm a dog who caught the car. Now what do I do?

Options:
* Salary at or below current: you collected a salary data-point;  let them know that you're not currently open to offers less than X * 1,5
* Salary below 50% increase: how happy you are in your current role and how this offer might impact your long term career goals?
* Salary above 50% increase: align your long term goals with compensation

### Why 50%

It compensates for the stress of the tech hiring process.  

### Other things to consider

* Suggest different roles
* Remote work
* Anything that aligns with your PDP
