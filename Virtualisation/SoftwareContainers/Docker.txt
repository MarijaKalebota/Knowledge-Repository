## Docker

Docker is a containerisation software that abstracts the operating system. That is in stark contrast to virtual machines which abstract hardware.


### Docker commands

docker cp - copy a file from the host to the Docker container
Example: docker cp transfer_object.txt sandbox-hdp:/usr/transfer_object.txt
