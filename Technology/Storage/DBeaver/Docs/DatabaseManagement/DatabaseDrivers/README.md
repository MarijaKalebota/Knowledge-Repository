Download and import JDBC drivers for each database. Check that you don't have pre-configured drivers.  

Install drivers:
* Downlaod the appropriate JDBC driver
* Place in the "plugins" folder of DBeaver
* Open Database -> Driver manager
* Pick the database that matches a downlaoded driver -> Edit... -> Library
* Delete any and all red drivers -> Add File -> add driver from the "plugins" folder

ToDo
You can use a pre-configured database driver or create a new driver.
