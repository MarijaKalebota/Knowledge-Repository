## Atom

A free, open-source and package upgradeable editor.  

Works best with scripting languages.  

Note: I no longer use it because it is far too slow to load.

### Install

Use the installer for Linux/Windows.  

### Regex

#### Capturing and Referencing Groups

```
\b(\w{2}) (\w{3})\b

$2 $1
```
