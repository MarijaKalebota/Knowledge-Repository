### Chapter 13: GM

Dungeon World is designed for a world of elves, orcs, dragons and magic where dark dangers mix with lighthearted adventure.  
GM has rules to follow, too. They referee, adjudicate, and describe the world.  
The following are the procedures and rules for whoever takes on the role of GM. They are not advice or optional tips.  

##### GMing Dungeon World: a Framework

The **agenda**: what you set out to do when you sit down at the table.  
The **principles**: guides that keep you focused on that agenda.  
The GM’s **moves**: concrete, moment-to-moment things you do to move the game forward.  

#### How To GM

At the table you will:
* Describe the situation: describe the immediate situation around the players at all times; use information (orc painted in blood swinging a hammer and yelling bloody murder) or lack of information (clattering armor and shuffling feet); say "What do you do?"; make a situation that requires a response
* Follow the rules, both GM and player moves
* Make moves; GM moves change the flow of the game
* Exploit your prep: you'll know something the players don't yet know; use that knowledge

#### Agenda

Do all the time:
* Portray a fantastic world
    * guts, guile, and bravery against darkness and doom
    * about adventure in hopes of a glorious reward
    * without the player characters the world would fall into chaos or destruction
    * show them the wonders of the world and encourage them to react to it
* Fill the characters' lives with adventure
    * work with players to create a dynamic and engaging world
    * don't assume player action
    * honestly portray the repercussions of actions
* Play to find out what happens
    * find out how players react
    * find out how the world changes

Your goal is NOT to:
* beat the players or test their mental abilities
* kill the players, though the monsters might
* tell a preplanned story

#### Principles

Principles are guides. You will already have an idea of what to make as a move. Go with it if it fits the principles.  

Principles
* Draw maps, leave blanks
    * They help everyone stay on the same page
    * Let the map change and expand
* Address the characters, not the players
* Embrace the fantastic
    * Magic, strange vistas, gods, demons and abominations
    * Various scales of fantastic: from floating cities to village wise-man
* Make a move that follows
* Never speak the name of your move
* Give every monster life
    * Give them a motive, smells, sights, sounds
* Name every person
    * Give them a name, personality, goal, opinions
* Ask questions and use the answers
    * Don't know everything
    * Be curious
    * If you don't have an idea, ask the players "What do you do?" and use theirs
* Be a fan of the characters
* Think dangerous
    * No single life is worth anything and there is nothing sacrosanct
    * Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed
    * Change the world; for the worse without character intervention
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Think offscreen, too

#### Moves

You make a move when:
* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens
* When the players give you a golden opportunity
* When they roll a 6-

Make a soft move when players are just looking at you to find out what happens, otherwise make a hard move.  
Hard moves have immediate and irrevocable consequences.  
Soft moves not all bad: offer an opportunity with cost, show signs of an approaching threat, ...
A soft move ignored can become a hard move.  
When you can make a hard move, you can opt to use a soft one instead.  

Make it a real thing that happens to them.  
Always follow up a move with: what do you do?
Make your moves snowball.  

Moves:
* Use a monster, danger, or location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
    * Reveal to the players just how much trouble they’re in
* Show signs of an approaching threat
    * Show them that something’s going to happen unless they do something about it
* Deal damage
* Use up them resources
    * It doesen't have to be permanent: a sword could be flung away not shattered
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities
* Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

#### Dungeon Moves

Use these if your players are exploring a hostile area that you don’t already have planned completely.  
They're particularly well-suited for when the characters enter a new room or hallway and want to know what they find there.  

Dungeon moves:
* Change the environment
    * Vary the types of areas and creatures the players will face
* Point to a looming threat
* Introduce a new faction or type of creature
    * Give some clear sensory evidence or substantiated information; don't be coy nor too obvious
* Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature
* Make them backtrack
    * Show the effect that time has had on the areas they’ve left behind
* Present riches at a price
    * Glory? Money? Respect? Time? Health?
* Present a challenge to one of the characters
    * Give a thief a lock, a wizard a magical mystery, a fighter skulls to crack

#### Dealing With Common Situations

Fights:
* try to think about more then exchanging damage
* understand what the fight is about, what each side wants
* move in and out of range, take cover, retreat, shift the battlefield
* make sure everyone has a chance to act
* make maps of complex battle location so everyone knows what's going on

Traps:
* players may find traps through clever plans, trap sense, or discerning realities

People:
* NPCs are not mindless stooges, but they’re not what we’re playing to find out about either
* use them to illustrate what the world is like
* common people struggling for recognition, nobles uplifting their people
* people, just like dungeons, change over time: they may become enraged or inspired
* when characters revisit a town, show them how it changed
* if the players want to make real, lasting connections with the people of the world, they need to act
