### Chapter 13: GM

Dungeon World is designed for a world of elves, orcs, dragons and magic where dark dangers mix with lighthearted adventure.  
GM has rules to follow, too. They referee, adjudicate, and describe the world.  
The following are the procedures and rules for whoever takes on the role of GM. They are not advice or optional tips.  

##### GMing Dungeon World: a Framework

The **agenda**: what you set out to do when you sit down at the table.  
The **principles**: guides that keep you focused on that agenda.  
The GM’s **moves**: concrete, moment-to-moment things you do to move the game forward.  

#### How To GM

At the table you will:
* Describe the situation: describe the immediate situation around the players at all times; use information (orc painted in blood swinging a hammer and yelling bloody murder) or lack of information (clattering armor and shuffling feet); say "What do you do?"; make a situation that requires a response
* Follow the rules, both GM and player moves
* Make moves; GM moves change the flow of the game
* Exploit your prep: you'll know something the players don't yet know; use that knowledge

#### Agenda

Do all the time:
* Portray a fantastic world
    * guts, guile, and bravery against darkness and doom
    * about adventure in hopes of a glorious reward
    * without the player characters the world would fall into chaos or destruction
    * show them the wonders of the world and encourage them to react to it
* Fill the characters' lives with adventure
    * work with players to create a dynamic and engaging world
    * don't assume player action
    * honestly portray the repercussions of actions
* Play to find out what happens
    * find out how players react
    * find out how the world changes

Your goal is NOT to:
* beat the players or test their mental abilities
* kill the players, though the monsters might
* tell a preplanned story

#### Principles

Principles are guides. You will already have an idea of what to make as a move. Go with it if it fits the principles.  

Principles
* Draw maps, leave blanks
    * They help everyone stay on the same page
    * Let the map change and expand
* Address the characters, not the players
* Embrace the fantastic
    * Magic, strange vistas, gods, demons and abominations
    * Various scales of fantastic: from floating cities to village wise-man
* Make a move that follows
* Never speak the name of your move
* Give every monster life
    * Give them a motive, smells, sights, sounds
* Name every person
    * Give them a name, personality, goal, opinions
* Ask questions and use the answers
    * Don't know everything
    * Be curious
    * If you don't have an idea, ask the players "What do you do?" and use theirs
* Be a fan of the characters
* Think dangerous
    * No single life is worth anything and there is nothing sacrosanct
    * Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed
    * Change the world; for the worse without character intervention
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Think offscreen, too

#### Moves

* Use a monster, danger, or location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
* Show signs of an approaching threat
* Deal damage
* Use up them resources
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities
* Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask
en to Make a Move
* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens
* When the players give you a golden opportunity
* When they roll a 6-
Hard moves have immediate consequences; soft moves do not.

#### Dungeon Moves

room or hallway and want toknow what they find there.
* Change the environment
* Point to a looming threat
* Introduce a new faction or type of creature
