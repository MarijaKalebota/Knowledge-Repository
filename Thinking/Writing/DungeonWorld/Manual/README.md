### Chapter 13: GM

Dungeon World is designed for a world of elves, orcs, dragons and magic where dark dangers mix with lighthearted adventure.  
GM has rules to follow, too. They referee, adjudicate, and describe the world.  
The following are the procedures and rules for whoever takes on the role of GM. They are not advice or optional tips.  

##### GMing Dungeon World: a Framework

The **agenda**: what you set out to do when you sit down at the table.  
The **principles**: guides that keep you focused on that agenda.  
The GM's **moves**: concrete, moment-to-moment things you do to move the game forward.  

#### How To GM

At the table you will:
* Describe the situation: describe the immediate situation around the players at all times; use information (orc painted in blood swinging a hammer and yelling bloody murder) or lack of information (clattering armor and shuffling feet); say "What do you do?"; make a situation that requires a response
* Follow the rules, both GM and player moves
* Make moves; GM moves change the flow of the game
* Exploit your prep: you'll know something the players don't yet know; use that knowledge

#### Agenda

Do all the time:
* Portray a fantastic world
    * guts, guile, and bravery against darkness and doom
    * about adventure in hopes of a glorious reward
    * without the player characters the world would fall into chaos or destruction
    * show them the wonders of the world and encourage them to react to it
* Fill the characters' lives with adventure
    * work with players to create a dynamic and engaging world
    * don't assume player action
    * honestly portray the repercussions of actions
* Play to find out what happens
    * find out how players react
    * find out how the world changes

Your goal is NOT to:
* beat the players or test their mental abilities
* kill the players, though the monsters might
* tell a preplanned story

#### Principles

Principles are guides. You will already have an idea of what to make as a move. Go with it if it fits the principles.  

Principles
* Draw maps, leave blanks
    * They help everyone stay on the same page
    * Let the map change and expand
* Address the characters, not the players
* Embrace the fantastic
    * Magic, strange vistas, gods, demons and abominations
    * Various scales of fantastic: from floating cities to village wise-man
* Make a move that follows
* Never speak the name of your move
* Give every monster life
    * Give them a motive, smells, sights, sounds
* Name every person
    * Give them a name, personality, goal, opinions
* Ask questions and use the answers
    * Don't know everything
    * Be curious
    * If you don't have an idea, ask the players "What do you do?" and use theirs
* Be a fan of the characters
* Think dangerous
    * No single life is worth anything and there is nothing sacrosanct
    * Everything can be put in danger, everything can be destroyed
    * Change the world; for the worse without character intervention
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Think offscreen, too

#### Moves

You make a move when:
* When everyone looks to you to find out what happens
* When the players give you a golden opportunity
* When they roll a 6-

Make a soft move when players are just looking at you to find out what happens, otherwise make a hard move.  
Hard moves have immediate and irrevocable consequences.  
Soft moves not all bad: offer an opportunity with cost, show signs of an approaching threat, ...
A soft move ignored can become a hard move.  
When you can make a hard move, you can opt to use a soft one instead.  

Make it a real thing that happens to them.  
Always follow up a move with: what do you do?
Make your moves snowball.  

Moves:
* Use a monster, danger, or location move
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
    * Reveal to the players just how much trouble they're in
* Show signs of an approaching threat
    * Show them that something's going to happen unless they do something about it
* Deal damage
* Use up them resources
    * It doesn't have to be permanent: a sword could be flung away not shattered
* Turn their move back on them
* Separate them
* Give an opportunity that fits a class' abilities
* Show a downside to their class, race, or equipment
* Offer an opportunity, with or without cost
* Put someone in a spot
* Tell them the requirements or consequences and ask

#### Dungeon Moves

Use these if your players are exploring a hostile area that you don't already have planned completely.  
They're particularly well-suited for when the characters enter a new room or hallway and want to know what they find there.  

Dungeon moves:
* Change the environment
    * Vary the types of areas and creatures the players will face
* Point to a looming threat
* Introduce a new faction or type of creature
    * Give some clear sensory evidence or substantiated information; don't be coy nor too obvious
* Use a threat from an existing faction or type of creature
* Make them backtrack
    * Show the effect that time has had on the areas they've left behind
* Present riches at a price
    * Glory? Money? Respect? Time? Health?
* Present a challenge to one of the characters
    * Give a thief a lock, a wizard a magical mystery, a fighter skulls to crack

#### Dealing With Common Situations

Fights:
* try to think about more then exchanging damage
* understand what the fight is about, what each side wants
* move in and out of range, take cover, retreat, shift the battlefield
* make sure everyone has a chance to act
* make maps of complex battle location so everyone knows what's going on

Traps:
* players may find traps through clever plans, trap sense, or discerning realities

People:
* NPCs are not mindless stooges, but they're not what we're playing to find out about either
* use them to illustrate what the world is like
* common people struggling for recognition, nobles uplifting their people
* people, just like dungeons, change over time: they may become enraged or inspired
* when characters revisit a town, show them how it changed
* if the players want to make real, lasting connections with the people of the world, they need to act

### Chapter 14: First Session

Begin with character creation, world creation and questions that establish who lives in it and what's going on.  

#### Prep

Print out handouts.  
Read about Fonts but don't create any.  
At a bare minimum bring a head full of stories to the table.  
You could also think up of a villain or a few monsters and draw a few maps with a few locations.  
Do NOT bring a planned storyline or plot to the table.  

During character creation:
* help everyone
* ask questions
* take notes

When a player makes a choice, ask them about it, get details.  
Set expectations: the players are to play their characters as people, real people.  
Be curious about player characters, search for interesting facts.  
Pay attention to player questions. You can turn questions about the setting back on them and get them to answer it.  
Work together to find interesting answers.  
Make sure everyone is excited about the broad strokes of the world.  

The first adventure is about discovering the direction that future sessions will take.  
Keep your eye out for unresolved threats, dangers mentioned but unresolved. They will be fuel for sessions to come.  
Start the session with the characters in a tense situation.  
Ask questions right away.  

First session goals:
* Establish details, describe
    * Establish the basics of what things look like, who's in charge, what they wear, what the world is like, what the immediate location is like
    * Keep it brief
    * Use a detail or two to make a description stand out as real
* Use what they give you
* Ask questions
* Leave blanks
* Look for interesting facts
* Help the players understand the moves
* Give each character a chance to shine
* Introduce NPCs
    * Give characters life especially if players show interest in them

#### After the First Session

Take some time to relax, let the ideas ferment.  
Don't rush into the next session.  

### Chapter 15: Fronts

Fronts are secret tomes of GM knowledge built outside of active play, a collection of linked dangers.  
Dangers are threats to the characters and to what they care about.  
Impending doom is what will happen without the characters' intervention.  

Fronts are designed to help you organize your thoughts on what opposes the players.  
They are your notes, ideas, and plans. When you're in a bind your fronts are where you're going to turn.  
Fonts are an organizational tool, as inspiration for present and future mayhem.  

Think in broad strokes and then narrow those ideas down.  

Make your campaign front and adventure fronts after your first session.  
Campaign front are big and scary overarching threats. Adventure fronts are episodic threats.  
When a danger from a front is unresolved, make it a bigger threat, a campaign front.  

#### Creating Fronts

Here's how a front comes together:
* Choose campaign front or adventure front
* Create 2-3 dangers
* Choose an impending doom for each danger
* Add grim portents (1-3 for an adventure front, 3-5 for the campaign front)
* Write 1â€“3 stakes questions
* List the general cast of the front

#### Creating Dangers

Dangers are divided into categories each with its own name and impulse.  
Dangers have a motivator, an impulse. It translate the danger into action.  
When creating dangers for fronts think how they contribute to the front.  
Keep in mind the people, places, and things that might be a part of the threat to the world that the front represents.  
Cultists, ogre chieftains, demonic overlords; goblin tribes or a rampaging centaur khanate; blasted landscapes, intelligent magical items, ancient spells woven into the fabric of time; godly patrons, hidden conspiracies and cursed prophecies.  

Limit yourself to three dangers. Leave blanks for discovery.  

#### Types of Dangers

Look up the list of danger types and their subcategories.  

Describe the danger in a nutshell.  
If there are multiple people involved in it give them a few details as well.  

Sometimes a danger will suggest a move. Create it.  

Grim portents are dark designs for what could happen if a danger goes unchecked.  
Grim portents are what happens if PCs didn't exist.  
When you're not sure what to do next, push your danger towards resolving a grim portent.  
In a complex front, you may need to cross off or alter the grim portents.  
Grim portents don't all have to be world-shaking. They can simply represent a change in direction for a danger.  

The impending doom is the danger's triumphant resolution.  
When a grim portent comes to pass the impending doom grows stronger, more apparent and present in the world.  

Your stakes questions are 1-3 questions about people, places, or groups that you're interested in.  
Stakes are a way of reminding yourself what you want to find out.  
Stakes are concrete and clear.  
Stakes are about important changes that affect the PCs and the world.  
When a stake is resolved it means that things will never be the same again.  
You must find stakes interesting, questions you genuinely want to know, but are also willing to leave to be resolved through play.  

#### Resolving a Front

A front representing a single dungeon may have its dangers killed, turned to good, or overcome by some act of heroism. In this case the front is dissolved and set aside.  
Some dangers might be unresolved and the front lives on.  

When the front is resolved, look at the aftermath. Is there anyone who could be moved from the now-defeated front to somewhere else? Anyone get promoted or reduced in stature?
