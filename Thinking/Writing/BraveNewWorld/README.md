## Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

### Chapter 1

Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre is run by a Director. It has a Fertilizing Room, Bottling Room, Social Predestination Room, Embryo Store
World State's motto: Community, Identity, Stability.  
It's the year A.F. 632.  
The Center makes Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. The last three undergo Bokanovsky's Process.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a series of arrests of development which divide the egg into multiple embryos that developed into adult clones.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a major instrument of social stability: mass production of twins.  
Podsnap's technique rippened humans to the age of 30 in 2 years.  
Mr. Foster joins the Director in showing the student around the Center.  
The amount of humans to be grown is determined by the Predestinators.  
Embryos travel on racks and are administered chemicals depending on their grade.  
Freemartins are sterile women.  
Lower casts, like Epsilons, are deprived of oxygen as embryos.  
The aim of conditioning is making people like their inescapable social destiny.

Hypnopedia or sleep-teaching is used for moral education: Alphas are better then Betas, Betas should be thankful and so forth...  
Even Alphas are conditioned.
