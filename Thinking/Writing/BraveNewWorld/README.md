## Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

### Chapter 1

Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre is run by a Director. It has a Fertilizing Room, Bottling Room, Social Predestination Room, Embryo Store
World State's motto: Community, Identity, Stability.  
It's the year A.F. 632.  
The Center makes Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. The last three undergo Bokanovsky's Process.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a series of arrests of development which divide the egg into multiple embryos that developed into adult clones.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a major instrument of social stability: mass production of twins.  
Podsnap's technique ripened humans to the age of 30 in 2 years.  
Mr. Foster joins the Director in showing the student around the Center.  
The amount of humans to be grown is determined by the Predestinators.  
Embryos travel on racks and are administered chemicals depending on their grade.  
Freemartins are sterile women.  
Lower casts, like Epsilons, are deprived of oxygen as embryos.  
The aim of conditioning is making people like their inescapable social destiny.  

### Chapter 2

Infant Nurseries floor contains the Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms.  
Delta babies are made to fear flowers and books, through 200 repetitions, by associating them with loud noises and electric shocks.  
Books may uncondition them and the dislike of flowers makes them more economically productive and less likely to go into the countryside.  
Polish, German and French are dead languages.  
Hypnopedia or sleep-teaching is used for moral education: Alphas are better then Betas, Betas should be thankful and so forth...  
Even Alphas are conditioned.  
Ford is worshiped.  

### Chapter 3

Games are designed to increase consumption.  
Erotic play between naked children as young as 8 years old in the Center's gardens is encouraged.  
Mustapha Mond is the Controller, one of ten, visiting the Center.  
Lenina is going out with Henry Foster, but her friend Fanny tells her she should be more promiscuous.  
The Controller emphasizes the need for stability and how family, lovers, mother-father-family stands in its way.  
"Every one belongs to every one else".  
The population of the World is 2 billion (two thousand million).  
Lenina is also going out with an Alpha-Plus Bernard Marks to a Savage Reservation.  
Bernard Marks has a bad reputation: loner, doesn't like Obstacle Golf, ...  
Bernard Marks is short and stunted, almost like a Gamma, resentful sleep teaching expert.  
The Controller is contemptuous of Christianity, parliament, liberalism, democracy,
There was a Nine Year War in which anthrax was used, water was poisoned, the economy collapsed.
Everyone is forced to consume a certain amount of goods per year, museums are closed, monuments are demolished, books are forbidden and the Past is destroyed.  
Soma, a powerful drug, is taken by people to create 'feelies'.  

### Chapter 4, Part 1

Lenina approaches Bernard in the lift filled with people about their plans. Bernard was uncomfortable.  
Benito is so good-natured he never needs to take soma.  
Henry and Lenina go off in a helicopter to play Obstacle golf.  

### Chapter 4, Part 2

Bernard thinks Lenina and Benito made him suffer. He feared rejection and being offered soma.  
Bernard doesn't like that Lenina went to play Obstacle Golf with Henry and that she spoke about their relationship so publicly.  
Bernard felt distress when dealing with lower castes: he was 8cm shorter of an Alpha and was slender. Each interaction was a painful reminder.  
Gemmas, Deltas and Epsilons are made to associate physical size with social superiority through sleep-learning.  
Bernard had to shout at the lower castes to have his orders obeyed and was mocked by his peers.  
Bernard goes to visit Helmholtz Watson in the Propaganda House.  
Propaganda House is home to the Music, Television and Newspaper Berauxes and the Collage of Emotional Engineering.  
Helmholtz Watson is powerfully built handsome Alpha-Plus that works as a writer. He too felt like an individual like Bernard because he was too smart.  
Helmholtz wants their newly invented phrases to be used for good. He feels a power within that he can't tap into.  
Helmholtz teaches students to write piercingly. Bernard is paranoid.

Twelve participants, including Bernard, perform a ritual where they sing hymns, listen to music, dance and drink soma.  
In the end they engage in drug induced sex which they call "orgy-porgy".  
Bernard feels nothing and lies to get through the ritual.  

### Chapter 6, Part 1

Bernard rebels against his inculcated society.  
Bernard blasphemes: "I want privacy", "I want to be myself", "I don't want soma", "I'm not just a  cell in a social body", "I don't want to be enslaved by my conditioning", "I want to be happy in my own way", "We went to bed like infants rather then waiting as adults".  
Lenina disagreed with Bernard at every single point.  

### Chapter 6, Part 2

Bernard hands a permit bearing the World Controller's Office and Mustapha Mond's signature to D.H.C. for him to sing it.

John explains the difficulties Linda had ina djusting to savage life: when she slept with many men, their wifes whiped her, she was too ashamed to go to the Inspector witha child, savages cruly rapped her, she did not know how to repair clothes, she even knew very little about the world she was previouslly living in.
John tired to kil Pope, but Pope caught him and let him run.

The room of Alphas is roaring with histerical laughter and the Director rushes out of the room.  

### Chapter 11

D.H.C. resigned and never stepped inside the Hatcheries and Conditioning.  
No one wants to see Linda: fat, old, bad teeth, blotched complexion and figure.  
Linda took increasing amounts of soma. Dr. Shaw prescribed them and said she would live about a month or two.
John objected to Dr. Shaw, but then relents.  
Bernard is exceptionally popular because everyone wants to see John.  
Helmholtz is saddened by Bernard's boasting and Bernard no longer want to talk to him.  
Bernard, now successful did not give up the privilege of criticizing the order which celebrates him. It made him feel gigantic.

### Chapter 16

John, Helmholtz and Bernard are in the Controller's study.  
Mustapha Mond asks John is he likes civilization. He says no. Bernard can only think of what that means for him.  
Mustapha Mond says he can break the rules because he makes them. He turns to Bernard and tells him that Bernard can't break them.  
The World Controller tells John that Othello is forbidden because people have to like the new not the old.  
Helmholtz says he's been trying to write Othello, but the Controller assures him he'll never allow it.  
Mustapha Mond explains:
* You can't make tragedies without social instability
* This world is stable, people are happy
* People get what they want and they never want what they can't get
* People are well off, they are safe, they are never ill, do not fear death and they have no mothers or lovers to feel strongly about
* People are condition to behave how they ought to behave. If anything goes wrong, there is soma
* Not having high art like Othello is the price of stability. High art was exchanged for the feelies and the scent organ
* The feelies and the scent organ mean themselves
* Enormous inginutiy is required when you need to write without saying anything, to make art out of pure sensation
* Actual hapiness is squalid compared to overcompensations for misery
* Stability isn't as spectacular as instability, being contented isn't as glamorous as a goof fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness against temptation or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand  
* Clones are the foundation of stability

Not everyone is an Aplha Double Plus because they'd go mad working the menial work of Epsilon Semi-Morons.  
Alphas a socialized by doing Alpha work. Epsilons make sacrifices because to them its the poath of least resistance.  
The Cyprus experiment: a society of only Alphas killed 19/22 thousands of their own on the island of Cyprus. Strikes, work, laws and orders were all disobeyed.  
Even after decanting, everyone is still isnide an invisible bottle thanks to conditioning.  
Lower casts are condition to love their work. They are happy thanks to soma, games, unrestricted copulation and feelies.  
Reducing the working hours from 8 to 3 will only increase soma consumption and unrest. Leisure does not increase happiness.  
"The Inventions Office is full of labor saving processes. Deploying them would be cruel because it would inflict excessive leisure."  
Scientific discoveries can cause changes, changes cause instability which is why even science is treated as an enemy.  
The World Controller was a physisict before. They did actual scienece and were almost sent to an island.  
Mustahpa Mond threatens Bernard that he'll send him to an island. Bernard grovels and acusses that others not him are causing truble.  
Bernard is taken to his room and given soma. The Controller muses that Bernard is actually being rewarded: the island is filled with people who are too self-conciously individual to fit into community life, people who don't like orthodoxy.  
The Controller chose not to go on the island and let science go to become a Controller.  
"Hapiness is a hard master - particualrly other people's hapiness. Much harder then truth."  
"Truth is a menace, scienece is a public danger."  
"We have stability thanks to scienece, but we cannot allow science to undo its own good work."  
"Our Ford shifted the focus from truth and beauty to comfort and hapiness."  
"Hapiness can keep the wheels turning indefinatly. Truth and beauty cannot."  
People clamoured for a quite life and gave up their appetites, truth, beauty and knowledge.  
"Hapiness has to be paid for."  
If there weren't so many islands, individuals who dislike orthodoxy would be put in the lethal chamber.  
Controller asks where Helmholtz would liek to be exiled. Helmholtz wants to be transfered to an island with a bad climate to help him focus on writing.  

### Chapter 17

God and religion are superflous thanks to youth and prosperity, no losses to compensate, endless youthful desire and no solitude.  
God is not compatible with machinery, medicine and happiness.  
People engage in plesent vices without risks.  
No person needs to do something unpleasent.  
There is no need to be heroic or courageous. The need for it never arrises  
If you are unlucky, take soma. You needn't work for girls: they belong to everyone.  
Violent Passion Surrogate (V.P.S.) is compulsory every month to flood you with adrenaline to satisfy the need for fear and rage.  
John claims the right to be unhappy. The Controlled says he is welcome to.  

### Chapter 18

John asked the Controller to go to the island with Bernard and Helmholtz. He refused and said the experiment must go on. John refused to let the experiment continue.  
John went to be alone in a lighthouse and made a hermitage.  
Isolated from the outside world, John likes doing work that requires skil and patieence.  
John whips himself in front of three Delta minus workers.  
John made a bow and arrors.  
Reporters came to do an interview with John. John kicked him the in behind. The news reported on this.  
John hugs a prickley bush to punish himself for thinking about Lenina rather then Linda.  
Darwin Bonaparte films John's hermit life and publishes a movie about it.  
Darwin's film attracted hundreds to John's lighthouse. They wanted to see him whip himself.  
They do the orgy-porgy. Next day, John hangs himself.
