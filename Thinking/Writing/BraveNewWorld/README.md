## Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

### Chapter 1

World State's motto: Community, Identity, Stability.  
It's the year A.F. 632.  
The Center makes Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. The last three undergo Bokanovsky's Process.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a series of arrests of development which divide the egg into multiple embryos that developed into adult clones.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a major instrument of social stability: mass production of twins.  
Podsnap's technique ripened humans to the age of 30 in 2 years.  
Mr. Foster joins the Director in showing the student around the Center.  
The amount of humans to be grown is determined by the Predestinators.  
Embryos travel on racks and are administered chemicals depending on their grade.  
Freemartins are sterile women.  
Lower casts, like Epsilons, are deprived of oxygen as embryos.  
The aim of conditioning is making people like their inescapable social destiny.  

### Chapter 2

Delta babies are made to fear flowers and books, through 200 repetitions, by associating them with loud noises and electric shocks.  
Books may uncondition them and the dislike of flowers makes them more economically productive and less likely to go into the countryside.  
Polish, German and French are dead languages.
