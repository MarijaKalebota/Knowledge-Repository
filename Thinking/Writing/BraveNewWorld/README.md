## Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

### Chapter 1

Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre is run by a Director. It has a Fertilizing Room, Bottling Room, Social Predestination Room, Embryo Store
World State's motto: Community, Identity, Stability.  
It's the year A.F. 632.  
The Center makes Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. The last three undergo Bokanovsky's Process.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a series of arrests of development which divide the egg into multiple embryos that developed into adult clones.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a major instrument of social stability: mass production of twins.  
Podsnap's technique ripened humans to the age of 30 in 2 years.  
Mr. Foster joins the Director in showing the student around the Center.  
The amount of humans to be grown is determined by the Predestinators.  
Embryos travel on racks and are administered chemicals depending on their grade.  
Freemartins are sterile women.  
Lower casts, like Epsilons, are deprived of oxygen as embryos.  
The aim of conditioning is making people like their inescapable social destiny.  

### Chapter 2

Infant Nurseries floor contains the Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms.  
Delta babies are made to fear flowers and books, through 200 repetitions, by associating them with loud noises and electric shocks.  
Books may uncondition them and the dislike of flowers makes them more economically productive and less likely to go into the countryside.  
Polish, German and French are dead languages.  
Hypnopedia or sleep-teaching is used for moral education: Alphas are better then Betas, Betas should be thankful and so forth...  
Even Alphas are conditioned.  
Ford is worshiped.  

### Chapter 3

Games are designed to increase consumption.  
Erotic play between naked children as young as 8 years old in the Center's gardens is encouraged.  
Mustapha Mond is the Controller, one of ten, visiting the Center.  
Lenina is going out with Henry Foster, but her friend Fanny tells her she should be more promiscuous.  
The Controller emphasizes the need for stability and how family, lovers, mother-father-family stands in its way.  
"Every one belongs to every one else".  
The population of the World is 2 billion (two thousand million).  
Lenina is also going out with an Alpha-Plus Bernard Marks to a Savage Reservation.  
Bernard Marks has a bad reputation: loner, doesn't like Obstacle Golf, ...  
Bernard Marks is short and stunted, almost like a Gamma, resentful sleep teaching expert.  
The Controller is contemptuous of Christianity, parliament, liberalism, democracy,
There was a Nine Year War in which anthrax was used, water was poisoned, the economy collapsed.
Everyone is forced to consume a certain amount of goods per year, museums are closed, monuments are demolished, books are forbidden and the Past is destroyed.  
Soma, a powerful drug, is taken by people to create 'feelies'.  

### Chapter 4, Part 1

Lenina approaches Bernard in the lift filled with people about their plans. Bernard was uncomfortable.  
Benito is so good-natured he never needs to take soma.  
Henry and Lenina go off in a helicopter to play Obstacle golf.  

### Chapter 4, Part 2

Bernard thinks Lenina and Benito made him suffer. He feared rejection and being offered soma.  
Bernard doesn't like that Lenina went to play Obstacle Golf with Henry and that she spoke about their relationship so publicly.  
Bernard felt distress when dealing with lower castes: he was 8cm shorter of an Alpha and was slender. Each interaction was a painful reminder.  
Gemmas, Deltas and Epsilons are made to associate physical size with social superiority through sleep-learning.  
Bernard had to shout at the lower castes to have his orders obeyed and was mocked by his peers.  
Bernard goes to visit Helmholtz Watson in the Propaganda House.  
Propaganda House is home to the Music, Television and Newspaper Berauxes and the Collage of Emotional Engineering.  
Helmholtz Watson is powerfully built handsome Alpha-Plus that works as a writer. He too felt like an individual like Bernard because he was too smart.  
Helmholtz wants their newly invented phrases to be used for good. He feels a power within that he can't tap into.  
Helmholtz teaches students to write piercingly. Bernard is paranoid.
