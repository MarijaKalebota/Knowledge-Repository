## Brave New World by Aldous Huxley

Read because `Neil Postman` in `Amusing Ourselves to Death` compared it to `Orwell`'s `1984`:
```
Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression. But in Huxley's vision, no Big Brother is required to deprive people of their autonomy, maturity and history. As he saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.

What Orwell feared were those who would ban books. What Huxley feared was that there would be no reason to ban a book, for there would be no one who wanted to read one.  
Orwell feared those who would deprive us of information. Huxley feared those who would give us so much that we would be reduced to passivity and egoism.  
Orwell feared that the truth would be concealed from us. Huxley feared the truth would be drowned in a sea of irrelevance.  
Orwell feared we would become a captive culture. Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy.  

In 1984, Orwell added, people are controlled by inflicting pain. In Brave New World, they are controlled by inflicting pleasure.  
In short, Orwell feared that what we fear will ruin us. Huxley feared that what we desire will ruin us.

### Chapter 1

Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre is run by a Director. It has a Fertilizing Room, Bottling Room, Social Predestination Room, Embryo Store and many more where people are grown rather then born.  
World State's motto: Community, Identity, Stability.  
It's the year A.F. (After Ford) 632.  
The Center makes Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. The last three undergo Bokanovsky's Process.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a series of arrests of development which divide the egg into multiple embryos that developed into adult clones.  
Bokanovsky's Process is a major instrument of social stability: mass production of twins.  
Podsnap's technique ripened humans to the age of 30 in 2 years.  
Henry Foster joins the Director in showing the student around the Center.  
The amount of humans grown is determined by the Predestinators.  
Embryos travel on racks and are administered chemicals depending on their caste.  
70% of all women are freemartins, sterile women.  
Lower castes, like Epsilons, are deprived of oxygen as embryos to make them physically and mentally deficient.  
The aim of conditioning is making people like their inescapable social destiny.  

### Chapter 2

Infant Nurseries floor contains the Neo-Pavlovian Conditioning Rooms.  
Delta babies are made to fear flowers and books, through 200 repetitions, by associating them with loud noises and electric shocks.  
Books are undesirable because they may decondition them and the dislike of flowers makes them more economically productive.  
Polish, German and French are dead languages.  
Hypnopedia or sleep-teaching is used for ensuring conformity and moral education: Alphas are better then Betas, Betas should be thankful and so forth...  
Even Alphas are conditioned.  
Ford is worshiped.  

### Chapter 3

Games are designed to increase consumption.  
Erotic play between naked children as young as 8 years old is encouraged.  
Mustapha Mond is the Controller, one of ten, visiting the Center.  
Lenina is going out exclusively with Henry Foster. Her friend Fanny tells says she should be more promiscuous.  
The Controller emphasizes the need for stability and how family and lovers are a threat to it.  
"Everyone belongs to everyone else".  
The population of the World State is 2 billion (two thousand million).  
Lenina is going out with an Alpha Plus Bernard Marks to a Savage Reservation.  
Bernard Marks has a bad reputation: loner, doesn't like Obstacle Golf and has unorthodox views.  
Bernard Marks is short, stunted and resentful sleep teaching expert.  
The Controller is contemptuous of Christianity, parliament, liberalism and democracy.  
There was a Nine Year War in which anthrax was used, water was poisoned, the economy collapsed and people clamored for stability.  
Everyone is forced to consume a certain amount of goods per year, museums are closed, monuments are demolished, books are forbidden and history is destroyed.  
Soma, a powerful drug, is taken by people to create feelies.  

### Chapter 4, Part 1

Lenina approaches Bernard in the lift filled with people. She talks about their plans to visit the Savage Reservation. Bernard is uncomfortable.  
Benito is so good-natured he never needs to take soma.

### Chapter 4, Part 2

Bernard thinks Lenina and Benito made him suffer. He feared rejection and being offered soma.  
Bernard doesn't like that Lenina went to play Obstacle Golf with Henry and that she spoke about their relationship so publicly.  
Bernard feels distress when dealing with the lower castes: he is 8cm shorter then an Alpha and is slender. Each interaction is a painful reminder of his stature.  
Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons are made to associate physical size with social superiority through sleep-learning.  
Bernard has to shout at the lower castes to have his orders obeyed and is mocked by his peers.  
Bernard goes to visit Helmholtz Watson in the Propaganda House.  
Propaganda House is home to the Music, Television and Newspaper Bureaux and the Collage of Emotional Engineering.  
Helmholtz Watson is powerfully built handsome Alpha Plus that works as a writer. He too feels like an individual, much like Bernard, but because he is too smart.  
Helmholtz wants his newly invented phrases to be used for good. He feels a power within that he can't tap into.  
Helmholtz teaches students to write piercingly. Bernard is paranoid.

### Chapter 6, Part 1

Bernard rebels against his inculcated society.  
Bernard blasphemes:
* "I want privacy."
* "I want to be myself."
* "I don't want soma."
* "I'm not just a cell in a social body."
* "I don't want to be enslaved by my conditioning."
* "I want to be happy in my own way."
* "We went to bed like infants rather then waiting as adults."
Lenina disagreed with each point.

The room of Alphas is roaring with hysterical laughter and the Director rushes out of the room.  

### Chapter 11

D.H.C. resigns and never steps inside the Centre ever again.  
No one wants to see Linda: fat, old, bad teeth, blotched complexion and figure.  
Linda took increasing amounts of soma. Dr. Shaw prescribed them and said she would live about a month or two.
John objected to Dr. Shaw, but then relents.  
Bernard is exceptionally popular because everyone wants to see John the Savage.  
Helmholtz is saddened by Bernard's boasting and Bernard no longer want to talk to him.

Bernard and Helmholtz come to the Hospital. John is asking Deltas : "Don't you want to be free and men?" (rather then slaves and babies).  
John begins to throw away the soma. Deltas charge at him. Helmholtz goes to help John. Bernard fears for his life and only pretends to be helping.  
Police arrive with goggles, gas masks, soma spraying machines, Synthetic Music Boxes and water pistols with anesthetic.

Police turn on the Music Box which speaks words that trigger Delta conditioning. Deltas begin to hug and kiss each other.  
The police Sargent takes John, Helmholtz and Bernard prisoner.  

### Chapter 16

John, Helmholtz and Bernard are in the Controller's study.  
Mustapha Mond asks John if he likes civilization. He says no. Bernard can only think how he'll be punished.  
Mustapha Mond says he can break the rules because he makes them. He turns to Bernard and tells him that Bernard can't break them.  
The World Controller tells John that Othello is forbidden because people have to like the new, not the old.  
Helmholtz says he's been trying to write Othello, but the Controller assures him he'll never allow it to be published.  
Mustapha Mond explains:
* You can't make tragedies without social instability
* This world is stable, people are happy
* People get what they want and they never want what they can't get
* People are well off, they are safe, they are never ill, do not fear death and they have no mothers or lovers to feel strongly about
* People are conditioned to behave how they ought to behave. If anything goes wrong, just take soma
* Not having high art like Othello is the price of stability. High art was exchanged for the feelies and the scent organ
* The feelies and the scent organ mean themselves
* Enormous ingenuity is required when you need to write without saying anything, to make art out of pure sensation
* Actual happiness is squalid compared to overcompensations for misery
* Stability isn't as spectacular as instability, being contented isn't as glamorous as a good fight against misfortune, has none of the picturesqueness against temptation or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand  
* Clones are the foundation of stability

Not everyone is an Alpha Double Plus because they'd go mad working the menial work of Epsilon Semi-Morons.  
Alphas socialized by doing Alpha work. Epsilons make sacrifices because, to them, its the path of least resistance.  
The Cyprus experiment: a society of only Alphas refused to work the land, organized strikes in the factories, laws and orders were ignored. After a deadly civil war, World Controllers took control.    
Even after decanting, everyone is still inside an invisible bottle thanks to conditioning.  
Lower casts are condition to love their work. They are happy thanks to soma, games, unrestricted copulation and feelies.  
Reducing the working hours from 8 to 3 only increased soma consumption and unrest. Leisure does not increase happiness.  
"The Inventions Office is full of labor saving processes. Deploying them would be cruel because it would inflict excessive leisure."  
Scientific discoveries can cause changes, changes cause instability which is why even science is treated as an enemy.  
The World Controller was a physicist. They did actual science, rather then the approve dogmatic science, and were almost sent to an island.  
Mustapha Mond threatens Bernard that he'll send him to an island. Bernard grovels and accuses others of causing trouble.  
Bernard is taken to his room and given soma. The Controller muses that Bernard is actually being rewarded: the island is filled with people who are too self-conscious and unorthodox to fit into community life. Islands are filled with the most interesting people.  
The Controller chose not to go to an island and let science go to become a Controller.  
"Happiness is a hard master - particularly other people's happiness. Much harder then truth."  
"Truth is a menace, science is a public danger."  
"We have stability thanks to science, but we cannot allow science to undo its own good work."  
"Our Ford shifted the focus from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness."  
"Happiness can keep the wheels turning indefinitely. Truth and beauty cannot."  
People clamored for a quite life and gave up their appetites, truth, beauty and knowledge.  
"Happiness has to be paid for."  
If there weren't so many islands, individuals who dislike orthodoxy would be put in the lethal chamber.  
Controller asks where Helmholtz would like to be exiled. Helmholtz wants to be transferred to an island with a bad climate. Misery will help him focus on writing.  

### Chapter 17

God and religion are superfluous thanks to youth and prosperity, no losses to compensate for, endless youthful desire and no solitude.  
God is not compatible with machinery, medicine and happiness.  
People engage in pleasant vices without risks.  
No person needs to do something unpleasant.  
There is no need to be heroic or courageous. The need for it never arises.    
If you are unlucky, take soma. You needn't work for girls: they belong to everyone.  
Violent Passion Surrogate (V.P.S.) is a compulsory monthly treatment in which subjects are flooded with adrenaline to satisfy the need for fear and rage.  
John claims the right to be unhappy. The Controlled says he is welcome to.  

### Chapter 18

John asked the Controller to go to the island with Bernard and Helmholtz. He refused and said the experiment must go on. John refused to let the experiment continue.  
John went to be alone in a lighthouse and made a hermitage.  
Isolated from the outside world, John likes doing work that requires skill and patience.  
John whips himself in front of three Delta Minus workers.  
John made a bow and arrows.  
Reporters came to do an interview with John. John kicked him the in behind. The news reported on this.  
John hugs a prickly bush to punish himself for thinking about Lenina rather then Linda.  
Darwin Bonaparte films John's hermit life and makes a movie about it.  
Darwin's film attracts hundreds to John's lighthouse. This includes Lenina and Henry. They wanted to see him whip himself.  
They do the orgy-porgy. Next day, John hangs himself.
