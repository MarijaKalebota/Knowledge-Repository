## The Last Wish

### The Witcher

#### The Voice of Reason

An enchantingly beautiful figure seductively interacts with the man lying in the bed.

#### I

A man from Rivia wins a fight inside a pub after being accused of being a thief.

#### II

No one was able to kill the Striga for seven years, the daughter of King Foltest and his sister Adda. Foltest hopes to cure the Striga while castellan Velerad offers Geralt an excuse and gold to kill it.

#### III

The witcher Geralt of Rivia questions King Foltest, castellan Velerad, magnate Lord Ostrit and guard captain Segelin about the Striga.

#### IV

Foltest meets with Geralt to discuss what might happen to the Striga when and if the curse if lifted.  

#### V

Ostrit comes to bribe Geralt to leave the Striga alive, because he hopes the Striga will incite a rebellion against Foltest, weakening him to an invasion from Novigrad.

#### VI

Geralt uses Ostrit as bait for the Striga and fights her with a silver sword, chain and gauntlet. He locks himself in the Striga's sarcophagus and waits until morning.

The Striga turned into a young dirt and blood soaked girl that wounds Geralt whilst he was inspecting her. Geralt passes out but not before biting her on the neck.  

#### VIII

Velerad bandages Geralt's wounds.

### A Grain of Truth

Geralt is being cared for by Chief Priestess of Melitele Nenneke in the Temple of Melitele. Nenneke wants a mute girl Iola to send Geralt into a trance.

#### I

Geralt finds and inspects a dead armorer, a woman, a blue rose and a ring off the beaten path.

#### II

Nivellen, a bear-like monster, plays host to Geralt, tells him a story of how he became a monster while walking through an enchanted house. He'd rather remain a monster then be transformed back into a human.

#### III

Geralt rests in the woods, against Nivellen's advice.

#### IV

Roach, Geralt's horse, finds a ring and makes Geralt realize he needs to go back to Nivellen house.

#### V

Geralt kills a vampire, a bruxa, and Nivellen turns back into a human after the bruxa confesses true love.
