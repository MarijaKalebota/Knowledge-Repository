## Thinking Fast and Slow

### Introduction

### Two Systems

#### 1 The Characters of the Story

`System 1` is fast and automatic, is us, the engine of action.  
`System 2` is slow and effortful, consumes attention.  

You have an attention budget. You can never spend more then you have.  
`Basketball gorilla` experiment demonstrates this budget.  

`System 1` makes suggestions to `System 2` which it usually accepts.  
`System 2` helps `System 1` when your model of the world is violated.  

`System 1` is biased, but often times accurately models the world.  

`Left/right and upper/lower case column` experiment demonstrates that `System 1` cannot be turned off.  
`System 2` gave you the self-control necessary to complete the experiment.  

`Muller-Lyre` (different fins, different lengths) illusion is solved by mistrusting your `System 1`.  
Measure the lines, form a belief that they are the same length and reject the suggestions made by System 1 that one is longer then the other.  

Cognitive illusions can be avoided by recognizing high risk situations and engaging `System 2`.  
Its easier to learn from other people's mistakes.  

#### 2 Attention and Effort

`Add-1` and `Add-3` tasks will strain `System 2`.  
Pupils dilate depending on how strained `System 2` is.  

You cannot control how much effort to put into completing a task.  
The law of least effort will make System 2 use the least amount of effort to complete a task.  
`System 2` will prioritize when it is overloaded.  

Switching between tasks is effortful.  
Thinking under time pressure requires effort.  

#### 3 Lazy Controller

`System 2` spends a bit of attention even if you are doing nothing.  
Vigorous physical activity demands attention from `System 2`.  

`Flow` is a state of mind when you effortlessly perform a mentally strenuous task.  
Self-control and performing a task draw from the same attention pool of `System 2`.  

`Ego depletion` is the loss of motivation after exerting self-control.  
`Ego depletion` can be undone by ingesting glucose.  

`Extraneous factors in judicial decisions` study looks at how judges put more effort into considering parole applications when they are sated.  

`Bat-and-ball`, `Flower syllogism` and `Michigan/Detroit` puzzles demonstrate the law of least effort, a lack of motivation.  

`Delayed gratification`, a type of self-control, is a good predictor of life success.  

#### 4 The Associative Machine

Daniel Kahneman: "I placed too much faith in underpowered studies"  
Be careful when acting on information presented in this chapter!  

`Associative activation` is a cascade of ideas triggered by an idea.  
`Associative coherence` is your varied and integrated way of responding to the cascade of ideas.  
`Associative memory` is a web of ideas.  

Principles of association as conceived by David Hume: resemblance, contiguity of space and time and causality.  

`Priming` is when a previous ideas leads you to the next.  
`Ideomotor effect` is when subconscious ideas effect motion.  
`Ideomotor` works in reverse. Motion can prime subconscious ideas.

### Heuristics and Biases

### Overconfidence

### Choices

### Two Selves

It is more enjoyable, easier to recognize and label mistakes others make, then out own.  
To understand judgements and gossip, you need a specialized vocabulary.  
Biases are predictable errors.  

The mind produces impressions, decisions and intuitions in silence.  
The book discusses biases of intuition.  

Resemblance heuristic, availability heuristic, : these all cause biases.
