## The Lies of Locke Lamora

### Prologue: The Boy Who Stole Too Much

It is the 77th year of Sendovani.  
Thiefmaker of Camora wants to sell the Eyeless Priest, also known as Fater Chains, the boy Locke Lamora.    
Calo and Galdo twins as well as Sabetha were sold by the Thiermaker to Father Chains.  
Therin and Vadran people exist.  
Shades' Hill is where the Thiermaker resides.  
Locke Lamora boy orphan comes from the Catchfire district that was ravaged by the Black Whisper plague.  
The disease spares the young children, for unknown reasons.  
Orphans not recruited by the Thiefmaker into thievery are:
* caught and hanged for their crimes
* sold into slavery to row on a galley ship
* starve
88 000 people live in Camora.  
In the 77th year of Gandolo Locke was recruited by the Thiefmaker, but only 2 years later, he wants to sell him off.  
The Thiefmaker has permission to kill Locke, but tries to sell him off instead.  
Hills of Whisper is a better graveyard.  
Shades' Hill graveyard was disintered, a network of tunnels was dug out and made into an ant-mound of orphan thieves.  
Locke Lamora stole even before the Black Whisper.  
Unfortunatly, he stole from the yellowjackets, the guards of Camora.  
Secret Peace is the agreement between the guards and the thieves that the guards will never be pickpocketed.  
The Thiefmaker had to return the stolen purses with interest and beg for forgivness.  
Capa Barsavi is the crime boss.  
Orphan thieves are either Windows or Streets.  
Streets are either cluthers or teasers: pickpockets or distraction makers.  
Locke was an excellent teaser, so much so that others came to watch him instead of working.  
Once, Locke pretended to have the Black Whisper.
The ensuing riot summoned the guards: fluest of the Quorentine Guard, the Ghouls.  
Duke Nicovante rules the city from the Five Towers.  
The Thiefmaker secured the right to kill Locke from Capa Barsavi.  
Father Chains is in the Temple of Perelandro.  
Angevine is a river that divides the fancy from the plain part of town.  
Elderglass is a glass like material that accumulates light and then shines for a few hours after dark.  
Falselight is the light given off by Elderglass.  
Father Chains isn't blind or chained, it is all just a rouse to extract money.  
Locke was sold to Father Chains with the death mark, the tooth of a wolf shark, by the Thiefmaker, which means he can kill Locke at anytime.  
The Thiefmaker decided to get rid of Locke after he arranged the death of two other Shades' Hill boys.  

### I: Ambition

#### Chapter One: The Don Salvara Game

Locke wants to play a confidence trick on Don Lorenzo Salvara.  
Jean Tannen, a 100 kilogram, 24 year old bruiser is part of Gentelemen Bastards.  
Bug is the 12 year old who will be a lookout and will distract anyone who interferes with Locke's plan.  
Locke Lamora is 24 years old.  
Palace of Patience is a prison run by the Duke of Camora.  
Tumblehome is a quality rooming house where the Gentleman will get into costume for the deception.  
Locke is Lucas Fehrwight from Emberlain and Jean is Graumann, Lucas' helper.  
Bug did get the guards' attention, but killed one in the process.  
Conte, the Don's bodyguard, and Don Lorenzo exit a temple and stumble upon the Gentlemen.  
The Don bit the hook and helped free Lucas/Locke and Graumann/Jean.  

Don Salvara owns the Nacozza Vineyards.  
Don Salvara's wife, Doña Sofia, is a botanical alchemist.  
House of Bel Auster is in the business of sale and transport of alcohol, wine.  
Don Paleri Jacobo is a sworn enemy of Don Salvara.  
Lucas tells the Don he wants to do business with Don Jacobo.  
Don Salvara invites Lucas and Graumann to his barge, the Shifting Revel.  
Evante Eccari, a solicitor of Razona district, but actually Calo in disguise, greets Lucas in the street.  
Bug escaped, hid in a barrel of wine and was delivered by horsecarriage to Calo and Galo.  

#### Interlude: Locke Explains

Locke explains to Father Chains how he got the two Shades' boys killed.  
After being bullied by Veslin and Gregor, he decided to steal a silver coin.  
He planted the coin and told the Thiefmaker the two were hiding it.  
The Thiefmaker killed them both.  

#### Chapter Two: Second Touch At The Teeth Show

Shifting Revel is an orchard pleasure barge owned by Don Salvara.  
Doña Sofia Salvara designed the barge.  
Locke will need her approval as well.  

The Revel is a debauch holiday, observed from the pleasure barges in the Shifting Market.  
Lucas says the Kingdom of the Seven Marrows is in conflict.  
Canton of Emberlain is peripheral to the conflict.  
Graf von Emberlain and the Black Table, says Locke, will place the canton in harms way.  
The Black Table is the council of Emberlain.  
House of bel Auster is a member of the Black Table.  
Trade Guilds run the other Cantons of the Kingdom of the Seven Marrows.  
The Stradas and the Dvorims, the Razuls and the Strigs, in the Kingdom of the Seven Marrows are shapening knives according to Locke.  
Lukas'/Locke's master of House of bel Auster does not agree with the majority opinion in the Black Table merchant council of Emberlain that the Graf von Emberlain be desposed.  
Lukas/Locke gifts the Don and Dona a 502 vintage.  
502 is lavishly expensive!  
Next, he shows them the 559 vintage, from last year.  
The Don and Dona are flabbergasted.  

Lukas/Locke is trying to convince the Salvaras to hire ships, crew and cargo to transport House of bel Auster's vintage brandy out of, soon to be under-siege by Graf and impounded by the Black Table, Emberlain.  
The Salvaras agree to the plan.  

#### Interlude: Locke Stays For Dinner

Father Chains explains to Locke that a white iron coin, a crown, is worth forty silver solons or two hundred and forty coppers.  
A crown is a two month wage of a city watchmen.  
He explains Locke's mistakes in arranging Veslin and Gregor to be killed:
* Locke stole too much money
* he framed Veslin with too much money
* he didn't control the game and it unintentionally spilled over to Gregor
* he showed the crown to other people
* he didn't back up his order and so witnesses spilled that Locke had done it

Father Chains explains that the Thiefmaker rules by fear.  
He probably killed all who knew about Locke's coin.  
Gang leaders are called Garristas.  
Thifmaker sells twelve year olds to other gangs, Gray Faces or Arsenal Boys.  
Father Chains made Locke promise to pay a thousand crowns in death-offerings for each boy and girl he carelessly got killed.  
Locke becomes part of the Gentleman Bastards.  
In the back of the temple, there are lavish furnishings for dining.  
Sabetha is also part of the Gentleman Bastards.  

#### Chapter Three: Imagenary Men

Don Lorenzo Salvara is visited by a Midnighter.  
Midnighters serve the Duke.  
Midnighters warn the Don that Lucas is a fraud, the Thorn of Camorr.  

The Gentleman Bastards are having a celebratory banquet in the barrows on the temple.  
Locke holds a signed document for five thousand crowns.  
Locke is on bad terms with Sabetha.  
Sabatha is in Parley.  

Don Salvara doesn't believe the Midnighters.  
Midnighters explain the coincidences:
* how they have observed the encounter in front of the temple with the Don
* how other Dons and Donas were robbed of their wealth, but their pride and honor prevented them from speaking about it
Don Salvara now believes the Midnighters, but they instruct him to go on pretending he trusts Lucas/Locke.  

Locke and Calo are dressing up as Midnighters.  
They talk about the Grey King and the Spider.  

Locke and Calo break into Don Salvara's manor.  
They were barely able to ambush and overpower Conte.  

There seems to be a shadow following them.  

#### Interlude: The Last Mistake

Wraithstone is a chalky white substance found in glass lined caverns abandonded by the Eldren, the race that built Camorr.  
Physikers identified that Wraithstone destroyes the mind, the personality.  
Father Chains, now in disguise, is taking Locke to see Capa Barsavi.  
Capa Bravsi doesn't audit or plant spies in Chains' gang because he helped him rise to power.  
Capa Barsavi is from Tal Verrar.  
Barsavi used to be a scholar at the Therin Collegium, taught rhetoric.  
Barsavi got a few gangs under his thumb and he started cutting throats of others.  
Before, there were thirty capas. Now there is one, Capa Barsavi.  
Barsavi made the Secret Peace with the guards: don't touch nobles, ships or crates with a legitimate coat of arms.  
There's more money passing through Camorr than any other city on the coast.  
Hundreds of ships a week; thousands of sailors and officers. We don't have any problem laying off the nobility.  
Floating Grave is an anchored galleon of Barsavi.  
Barsavi used a carpet to create the expectation that if it was rolled out, he wouldn't kill you.  
Barsavi lured the gang leaders into a false sense of security.  
Barsavi rolled out the carpet, but killed the gangs.  
Capa Vencarlo Barsavi is feared more then the Duke.  
The Last Mistake is a watering hold at the bottom of a cracked Elderglass tower, the Broken Tower.  
Capa Vencarlo Barsavi's daughter is Nazca Belonna Jenavais Angeliza de Barsavi.  
Locke swore aligence to Capa Barsavi.  
Barsavi had the shark tooth enchanted to cut anyone who tried to swallow it.  
Fatcher Chains told Locke that he must only appear to respect Capa Barsavi and the Secret Peace.  
Chains intends to train the Gentleman Bastards to be a 'bolt through the Secret Peace'.  

### II: Complication

#### Chapter Four: At The Court Of Capa Barsavi

Salvara handed over more money to Lukas.  
Money is piling up in the vaults, but Calo, Galdo, Jean, Bug and Locke have nothing to do with it.  
Spending money would alert suspicion.  
Bullshit Box is a chest filled with suppossedly stolen item actually bought from pawnshops and markets in other towns.  
Loot from the box is used to fool Capa Barsavi into thinking the Gentleman Bastards are doing well, but ain't rich.  
The Cauldron is the most disgusting, gut-wrenching district of Camorr.  

Nervous Vitale, the ferryman and member of the Gray Faces gang tells them that the Gray King killed Tall Tesso from Full Crowns.  
Barsavi has a yonger son, Pachero.  

The Bastards sell their loot at the pawnshop of No-Hope Harza to get the word out to Barsavi that they are stealing.  

Bernell the guard is greeted by Locke.  
Barsavi has Sage Kindness with him.  
Anjais and Pachero are sons of Barsavi.  
Nazca warns Locke that Barsavi is mad, doesn't sleep, has guards everywhere at all times and is scared to walk in public.  
Nazca thinks they aren't betrayed, but outmatched.  

Barsavi tortured and killed eight members of the Full Crowns who claim they have no memory of how Tall Tesso was killed last night.  
Barsavi has a high opinion of Locke who took over from Father Chains four years ago.  
Capa Barsavi wants Locke to court his daughter Nazca.  
Capa Barsavi wants Locke to start stealing more to impress her.  

Nazca sees Locke as a friend, not as a husaband.  
Locke is in love with Sabatha and Nazca knows as much.  

Gentleman Bastards are not known to be operating from the old temple, House of Perelandro.  
Locke convinced the Gentleman that they keep robbing the Don and visiting Nazca.  
Nazca and Locke will come up with a plan.  

#### Interlude: The Boy Who Cried For A Corpse

Chains predicts that the Sanza brothers, Calo and Galdo, will be tamed by Locke as he's better then them at mischief.  
Chains instructed the three in how to speak Vadran.  
Then came learning how to cook.  
After that, instructions about everything except thievery.  
Chains owns a favour to a Black Alchemist.  
The Guild of Alchemists are strict about how and with whome they do business.  
Black Alchemists operate outside the Guild, they are owned by Capa Barsavi, make poisons and are not to be messed with.  
Jessaline d'Aubart is the Black Alchemist that gave Chains the antidote to the poison.  
Now she wants a corpse from Beggar's Barrow.  
Calo and Galdo gladly made Locke the brains of the operation.  

Order of Perelando initiates are are generally respected.  
Catbridges are Eldren made, they cross the canals, but are only hip wide.  
The Old Citadel district was the home of the dukes of Camorr.  
The current Duke's predecessor took up residence in Raven's Reach, a glass tower.  
Their previous home became the Palace of Patience.  
The Palace housed yellowjacket officers and the duke's twelve, month named, magistrates.  
The Palace is ten stories high, has four towers, one at each corner, on the sides of these hung black iron crow cages.  
Spider cages are a pair of ever revolving cages that didn't let their captives a moment's rest.  
Criminals would be lowered into the river from the Black Bridge to drown.  
Camorr Bay is infested with sharks.  

Locke needs Chains to find the names of people who will be hanged.  

Penance day was the day for hanging prisoners.  
Clerks at the courtyard of the Palace have stalls.  
Galdo, Calo and Locke approach the clerk about the body of Antrim One-Handed.  
Locke bribes the clerk with three purses of money.  

Masters of the Ropes are the executioneers.  
Aza Guilla is the godess of death to which corpses are usually delivered.  
Videnza is the high street.  
Locke buys candles from Madam Strollo.  
Calo pretend robs Locke and it causes an uproar.  
The merchants and the watch-sergeant all chipped in to replace what Calo robbed from Locke.  

#### Chapter Five: The Grey King

Dona Sofia Salvara gives Lucas another four thousand solons.  
Dona and Conte are annoyed at Lucas.  

Locke felt contentment.  
Locke finds himself alone in what should be the most populated park.  
He felt forced to turn around.  
Locke lost conciousness just after speaking to crossbow armed men who called him Master Thorn.  

When he came to, he was sitting in a delapidated tavern.  
The man talking to Locke knows a lot: that Lucas is a disguise, that the Don and Dona were duped, that Jean is also disguised, that Locke pretended to be a Midnighter.  
Locke thinks he is conversing with a real Midnighter. However, he is talking to the Grey King.  
The Grey King moves unnaturally fast.  
The Grey King employs a Bondsmage or Karthain, the Falconer with a deformed bird of prey.  

Bondsmagi of Karthain have a monopoly on sorcery: you either join them or die.  
They enforce their Guilde rules with violence.  
They are extremely expensive to have on retainer.  

Locke immediatly disrespects and swares at the Bondsmage.  
The bird of prey, Vestris, is a falcon-scorpion hybrid.  
It bloodies Locke and he apologizes.  
The Grey King knows everything about Locke and the Bastards.  
The Grey King wants Locke to become him and in turn he won't give him up to Capa Barsavi.  
The Grey King will lure Barsavi out to speak one-on-one to the Grey King who will infact be Locke.  
The Grey King is sure Locke will be able to disguise himself, he'll coach Locke on what to say and the Bondsmagi will protect Locke from crossbow death.  
Locke requests a way to talk to the Grey King. Falconer gives Locke a candel.  

When Locke wakes up again he is late for his meeting with Jean.  

Locke tells the Bastards about the Grey King.  
Calo asks if they can run away, Bug wants to kill the King with a crossbow.  
Bastards devise an escape plan.  
Capa Barsavi wants to see Locke. He sent Red Hands, the best muscle, to bring Locke to Capa.  

#### Interlude: Jean Tannen

Locke Lamora is runty.  
Jean Tannen was delivered to Chains by the Thiefmaker, but this time Chains paid the Thiefmaker not the other way around.  
Jean can already speak three languages and do sums.  
Locke dislikes Jean because he is soft, fat and not athief, a merchant's son, emotional, crying, but learned.  
Jean attacks and beats Locke for speaking so casulaly about his dead parents.  

Jean is better at using the Determiner's Box, a calculator, then Locke.  
Chains demonstrates to Locke that Jean's skills are very valuable.  
Jean is close-blind, not far-blind.  

#### Chapter Six: Limitations

Red Hands lead Locke to the Floating Grave now guarded by even more grim-faced sentires.  
Capa Barsavi shows his daughter Nazca's corpse.  
She snuck out, was caught, killed and washed or drowned in horse urine.  
The Grey King wrote a letter to Capa Barsavi: he wants the two of them to meet.  
Capa Barsavi wants Locke and Jean to be by his side at the meeting.  
Capa Barsavi insists on trying to kill the Grey King even if he does have a Bondsmagi.  
Capa Barsavi wants Locke to come as a priest tommorow to bury Nazca.  

Locke explains how dire the situation really is to the Bastards.  
Calo says that now that Nazca has been killed, there is no possiblity of peace: either the Grey King or the Capa have to die.  
Galdo advocates running away.  
Current plan: Locke plays the Grey King, splits from his commitment to Capa, Jean is with Capa, Galdo and Calo move about and Bug lurk and spots for them.  

Locke lit the candel and the Falconer appeared.  
Locke is yet again flippant to the Falconer.  
The Falconer tortures Locke and says he'll do it to the Bastards if he's anything but abjactly obidient and respectful of the Falconer's time.  
The Falconer will direct Locke psyonically.  

Locke tells the Bastards what the Falconer did to him.  
Locke will first go to the Guilded Lilies, dispite his love for Sabatha.  
Even the whores of the Guild know that Locke is in love with Sabatha.  

#### Interlude: Brat Masterpieces

Chains tells Locke he isn't made for bruising.  
However, he will learn the steel, the rope and the alley-piece, but rom the side, the back and in the dark.  
Chains explains: Locke is the brains/liar, Calo and Galdo are silver, but gold at nothing, Sabatha is the charmer and Jean will be the bruiser.  
Jean will go four times a week to the best school of arms headed by Don Tomsa Maranzalla, the House of Glass Roses.  

Don Maranzalla is the Duke's personal swordmaster and the commander of the blackjackets.  
The House of Glass Roses is made of Elderglass. It is huge and looks like it is made of bright diamonds.  
In the Garden Without Fregrance, touch nothing if you value your life. It is filled with glass roses which are very sharp and drink human blood.  
The Don is waiting at the center of the room, with a dozen boys watching a duel.  
The Boys are sons of the nobility.  
Jean entering distracts Lorenzo, one of the dualists, and he is pierced by a rapier.  
The boys have sweated their tunics to translucency and many were red-faced.  
The Don tests Jean's temper and courage and promises he'll train him hard.  
The Don says he can't be seen teaching Jean by the noble boys: they are learning fencing, Jean is learning how to kill.  

#### Chapter Seven: Out The Window

Locke will excuse himself from being at Capa's side.  

Calo and Galdo go to the Black Alchemist: Jessaline d'Aubart and her daughter Janellaine.  
They are looking to purchase something that'll make Jean and Locke sick.  
The Alchemist mother-daughter give them two plants, one to make him sick and another as an antidote.  
They pay five crowns for it, a huge amount!  

Locke drinks the red pouch powder.  
Anjais arrives and says Locke and Jean should stay home.  

Locke looks ten years older and ten kilograms lighter.  
Jean helps Locke recover.  

Vine Highway is a lattice of wood threaded with vines.  
Locke and Jean descend down the Highway, so the Broken Tower tavern patrons don't see them.  
There are two other people with the same idea: the naked woman and Ferenz, her lover.  
Locke and Jean enter the woman's room.  
Her husband, Gathis, bursts in, drunk and crazy, pulls out a stilleto and attacks them, thinking they slep with her.  
The Falconer's bird moves past them.  

#### Interlude: Up The River

Jean is at the House of Glass Roses, Calo apprenticed as the initiate in the Order of Gandolo and Galdo as the initiate in the Order of Sedovani.  
Locke will apprentice as a farmer on Villa Senziano.  
Chains will pretend to be a priest of Dama Elliza and says that Locke is going to work the earth as part of his service to the godess.  

Five Towers of Camorr: Dawncatcher, Blackspear, Westwatch, Amberglass and Raven's reach the Palace of the Duke.  
Lots of people want to enter Camorr.  
Outside Camorr, neighborhood after neighborhood of lightly built stone and wooden buildings look like cities to people who haven't been in a proper city.  
Blackjackets, the soldiers, and the yellowjackets, the Camorr guards don't like each other.  
Blackjackets are clannish and catish, willing to fight over anything and everything. They are recruited outside the city.  
Yellowjackets are city boys who would rather stay in the city.  
Chains was a blackjacket once. If he stayed for twenty five years he would have been given a plot of land.  
Chains comes from Villa Senziano and he will leave Locke in the care of Vandros, a survivor who did serve for twenty five years.  
The third surviver is Don Tomsa Maranzalla, the Master of the House of Glass Roses.  
The real reason for Locke apprenticeship is for Chains to see what Locke will do in a strange new place, all on his own.  

#### Chapter Eight: The funeral cask

Capa Barsavi's funeral procession is going toward Echo Hole.  
They are dressed for violence, not for a funeral.  
The cask is empty. Nazca's body is alchemically impregnated and still at the Floating Grave.  

Jean, Calo and Galdo are dressing, threading and applying makeup to Locke.  
Locke is practicing the accent.  
Jean, Bug, Calo and Galdo are going to take up positions.  
The Falconer is summoning Locke, now dressed up as the Grey King.  

Echo Hole is a grey cube of stone with one door at the end of a high stairway.  
An aquaduct is connected to the Echo Hole and drops water into the hole in the floor down into the catacombs.  
Vencarlo Barsavi, his sons Anjais and Pachero, Berangias sisters and a hundred killers and murderers from all the Capa's gangs.  
Locke summoned the Grey King from inside, his grin, his wolfishness and superiority.  
Capa has his men release a dozen crossbow bolts into him: they all bounced off thanks to the Falconer.  
Capa Barsavi sends forth Eymond to grab the Grey King's arm.  
Locke is grabbed, pushed and falls on his ass.  
Locke is surrounded, grabbed by everyone and Capa Barsavi punches him.  

Bondsmagi spells are very specific.  
Capa Barsavi was visited by one of Grey King's men who told him everything about the Grey King and who really is.  
Capa Brasavi says that the Grey King's Bondsmagi left his service last night.  
Locke doesn't want to identify himself because he already displayed Bondsmagi powers and he fears Capa would kill the Bastards.  
Capa and his men are beating Locke to death.  
Capa and his men plant Locke face first into a cash of urine.  
Locke begins to cry.  
They seal the barrel and throw it off the Echo Hole.  
Barsavi calls for celebrations.  

#### Interlude: The half-crown War

The reason for apprenticeshiping at different templates was to make sure the Bastards could throw on a robe and disappear for a little while.  
Tesso Volanti's gang of ten year old gang, Half-Crowns, wants the Bastards to give him preference or go to soft talk.  
Preference means bending the knee.  
Soft talk means fighting without weapons or crippling.  
Chains knew seconds of Full Crowns, the Half-Crowns, were sweeping the neighbourhood.  
He told the Bastards that they should either fight with Jean or use a clever tactic or not get caught.  

Jean beat the Half-Crowns from the ambuch.  
They were not one to one.  

Locke beat Tesso by allowing Tesso to beat the hell out of him, but then Jean arrived to help out Locke and beat up Tesso.  

### III: Revalation

#### Chapter Nine: A curious tale for countess Amberglass

Dona Sofia Salvara is visiting the Dona Angiavesta Vorchenza, dowager countess of Amberglass.  
Dona Vorchenza is the last of her line and the Amberglass Tower will most likely pass to another noble family.  
Dona Sofia is confiding in Dona Vorchenza that Lorenzo and her are being robbed by Midnighters and Lucas.  

Dona Vorchenza summons Reynart as Dona Salara is leaving.  
Reynart is the captain of the Nightglass Company, the blackjackets.  
Reynart says his men did not visit the Salvaras.  

Dona Vorchenza set a plan in motion that will trap the Thorn of Camorr: invitation to Raven's Reach, observation of Thumblehome and Meraggio's, check up on Evante Eccari and Lucas Fehrwight.  

#### Interlude: The schoolmaster of Roses
