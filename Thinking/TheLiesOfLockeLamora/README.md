## The Lies of Locke Lamora

### Prologue: The Boy Who Stole Too Much

It is the 77th year of Sendovani.  
Thiefmaker of Camora wants to sell the Eyeless Priest, also known as Fater Chains, the boy Locke Lamora.    
Calo and Galdo twins as well as Sabetha were sold by the Thiermaker to Father Chains.  
Therin and Vadran people exist.  
Shades' Hill is where the Thiermaker resides.  
Locke Lamora boy orphan comes from the Catchfire district that was ravaged by the Black Whisper plague.  
The disease spares the young children, for unknown reasons.  
Orphans not recruited by the Thiefmaker into thievery are:
* caught and hanged for their crimes
* sold into slavery to row on a galley ship
* starve
88 000 people live in Camora.  
In the 77th year of Gandolo Locke was recruited by the Thiefmaker, but only 2 years later, he wants to sell him off.  
The Thiefmaker has permission to kill Locke, but tries to sell him off instead.  
Hills of Whisper is a better graveyard.  
Shades' Hill graveyard was disintered, a network of tunnels was dug out and made into an ant-mound of orphan thieves.  
Locke Lamora stole even before the Black Whisper.  
Unfortunatly, he stole from the yellowjackets, the guards of Camora.  
Secret Peace is the agreement between the guards and the thieves that the guards will never be pickpocketed.  
The Thiefmaker had to return the stolen purses with interest and beg for forgivness.  
Capa Barsavi is the crime boss.  
Orphan thieves are either Windows or Streets.  
Streets are either cluthers or teasers: pickpockets or distraction makers.  
Locke was an excellent teaser, so much so that others came to watch him instead of working.  
Once, Locke pretended to have the Black Whisper.
The ensuing riot summoned the guards: fluest of the Quorentine Guard, the Ghouls.  
Duke Nicovante rules the city from the Five Towers.  
The Thiefmaker secured the right to kill Locke from Capa Barsavi.  
Father Chains is in the Temple of Perelandro.  
Angevine is a river that divides the fancy from the plain part of town.  
Elderglass is a glass like material that accumulates light and then shines for a few hours after dark.  
Falselight is the light given off by Elderglass.  
Father Chains isn't blind or chained, it is all just a rouse to extract money.  
Locke was sold to Father Chains with the death mark, the tooth of a wolf shark, by the Thiefmaker, which means he can kill Locke at anytime.  
The Thiefmaker decided to get rid of Locke after he arranged the death of two other Shades' Hill boys.

House of bel Auster is a member of the Black Table.  
Trade Guilds run the other Cantons of the Kingdom of the Seven Marrows.

Father Chains explains to Locke that a white iron coin, a crown, is worth forty silver solons or two hundred and forty coppers.  
A crown is a two month wage of a city watchmen.  
He explains Locke's mistakes in arranging Veslin and Gregor to be killed:
* Locke stole too much money
* he framed Veslin with too much money
* he didn't control the game and it unintentionally spilled over to Gregor
* he showed the crown to other people and din't back up his order and so they spilled that Locke had done it

Father Chains explains that the Thiefmaker rules by fear.  
He probably killed all who know about Locke's coin.  
Garrista is a name for a gang leader.

Before there were thirty capas. Now there is one, capa Barsavi.  
Barsavi made the Secret Peace with the guards: don't touch nobles, ships or crates with a legitimate coat of arms.  
There’s more money passing through Camorr than any other city on this coast, boy. Hundreds of ships a week; thousands of sailors and officers. We don’t have any problem laying off the nobility

### II: Complication

#### Chapter Four: At The Court Of Capa Barsavi

Salvara handed over more money to Lukas.  
Money is piling up in the vaults, but Calo, Galdo, Jean, Bug na dLOcke have nothing to do with it.  
Spending money would alert suspicion.  
Bullshit Box is a chest filled with suppossedly stolen item actually bought from pawnshops and markets in other towns.  
Loo t from the box is used to fool Capa Barsavi into thinking the Gentleman Bastards are doing well, but ain't rich.

Barsavi has a high opinion of Locke who took over from Father Chains four years ago.

Locke convinced the Gentleman that they keep robbing the don and visiting Nazca.
