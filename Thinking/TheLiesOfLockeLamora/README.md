## The Lies of Locke Lamora

### Prologue: The Boy Who Stole Too Much

It is the 77th year of Sendovani.  
Thiefmaker of Camora wants to sell the Eyeless Priest, also known as Fater Chains, the boy Locke Lamora.    
Calo and Galdo twins as well as Sabetha were sold by the Thiermaker to Father Chains.  
Therin and Vadran people exist.  
Shades' Hill is where the Thiermaker resides.  
Locke Lamora boy orphan comes from the Catchfire district that was ravaged by the Black Whisper plague.  
The disease spares the young children, for unknown reasons.  
Orphans not recruited by the Thiefmaker into thievery are:
* caught and hanged for their crimes
* sold into slavery to row on a galley ship
* starve
88 000 people live in Camora.  
In the 77th year of Gandolo Locke was recruited by the Thiefmaker, but only 2 years later, he wants to sell him off.  
The Thiefmaker has permission to kill Locke, but tries to sell him off instead.  
Hills of Whisper is a better graveyard.  
Shades' Hill graveyard was disintered, a network of tunnels was dug out and made into an ant-mound of orphan thieves.  
Locke Lamora stole even before the Black Whisper.  
Unfortunatly, he stole from the yellowjackets, the guards of Camora.  
Secret Peace is the agreement between the guards and the thieves that the guards will never be pickpocketed.  
The Thiefmaker had to return the stolen purses with interest and beg for forgivness.  
Capa Barsavi is the crime boss.  
Orphan thieves are either cluthers or teasers: pickpockets or distraction makers.  
Locke was an excellent teaser, so much so that others came to watch him instead of working.  
Once, Locke pretended to have the Black Whisper.
The ensuing riot summoned the guards: fluest of the Quorentine Guard, the Ghouls.  
Duke Nicovante rules the city from the Five Towers.  
The Thiefmaker secured the right to kill Locke from Capa Barsavi.  
Father Chains is in the Temple of Perelandro.  
Angevine is a river that divides the fancy from the plain part of town.  
Elderglass is a glass like material that accumulates light and then shines for a few hours after dark.  
Falselight is the light given off by Elderglass.  
Father Chains isn't blind or chained, it is all just a rouse to extract money.  
Locke was sold to Father Chains with the death mark, the tooth of a wolf shark, by the Thiefmaker, which means he can kill Locke at anytime.  
The Thiefmaker decided to get rid of Locke after he arranged the death of two other Shades' Hill boys.
