Make leading and open ended questions about point of interest.  

Dangers have a category/theme, an impulse/ motivation, a horrible Impending Doom.  

Grim Portents are what happens when a Danger goes unchecked.  
Grim Portents warn players about the Impending Doom.  
Grim Portents can be stopped.  
Grim Portents hint at the next Grim Portent.

Stakes are something interesting, something you rally want to find know.  
Concrete, clear and unresolved.
