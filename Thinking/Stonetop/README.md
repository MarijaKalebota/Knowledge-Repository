## Stonetop

### I wonder...

A running list of open questions, things that you wonder about but:
* you don't know how to ansswer
* you want to leave unanswered for now and see it get answered through play

Use the list to help identify:
* the adventure's central opportunity or threat
* help write the setup questions that you'll ask the characters

Refer to this list when you need something interesting to say.  

See [GettingStarted](BookOne\01GettingStarted).  

### Establish the situation

* Frame the action: who?, when?, where?
* Describe the environment: 3 strong impressions, smell, sound, sight, focusing on what matters
* Give details and specifics: it'll give the situation texture
* Ask questions, ask for input: don't ask them to make up details, but what they are feeling or experiencing or what they are doing or what they are thinking about

See [RunningStonetop](BookOne\02RunningStonetop).  

### Prep

Gives you interesting stuff to say.  

* Threats: ongoing, recurring problems that cause trouble for the PCs, things that are going to get worse if left unchecked
* Hooks: when you want to push the PCs into the field with a threat or an opportunity
* Expeditions: prepare your choices for the Chart a Course move; drawing a map, prepping points of interest and roughly imagining a few encounters
* Locations: important place you expect the PCs to explore or encounter during a session. What's it like? How will you describe it? What questions will you ask about it? What's its story? Do you need a map or a visual aid? Are there dangers or discoveries within?
* Dangers: hazards and monsters and hostile NPCs
* Discoveries: puzzles, clues, mysteries, treasures, arcana
* NPCs: think about their names, the questions you'll ask about them, their defining traits, how you'll describe them and potray them

See [RunningStonetop](BookOne\02RunningStonetop).  

### After each session

* Review your agenda:
    * Did the world feel flat, hollow, arbitrary?
    * Did you let things drag?
    * Did you force things down the path that you thought they should go?
    * What would pursuing my agenda have looked like? Do that next time!
* Review your principles:
    * Did you ever fail to follow them?
    * How did it impact the game?
    * What would following the principle have looked like instead? Do that next time!
* When were you stumped as to what to do next?
    * Where were you in the loop when you got stuck?
    * What could you have done differently?
    * What sort of prep might have helped? Prep more of that!
* Did you miss to trigger certain moves?
    * Did you miss any moves getting triggered?
    * Did you call for a player move, even though its trigger wasn't really met?

See [RunningStonetop](BookOne\02RunningStonetop).  

### Harm and Healing

Types of harm:
* damage to HP
* debilities
* problematic wounds
* death or lethal wound

HP definitely are not a measure of how injured or uninjured a character is.  
They're a combination of fighting spirit, determination, pluck, luck, and skill; the ability to turn what should be a lethal blow into a graze.  

Align it with the flow of fiction.  
If you don't know what harm you want to inflict, let me damage roll inform you.  
Messy and forceful tagged attacks are especially destructive.  

See [HarmAndHealing](BookOne\04HarmAndHealing).  

### Goals

* Paint a picture of daily life: pictures of their home, mundane life, a home worth fighting for
* Explore relationships: push NPCs and their relationships into the spotlight
* Identify what's important to them: 
* Push them into the field: don't let the village itself be a major source of conflict, at least not at first
* Establish details, but leave blanks: be asking questions like crazy
* Play up both the mundane and the mysterious: have a bit of both
* Draw them back home: encourage them to go home  

See [FirstAdventure](BookOne\05FirstAdventure).  

### Running the journey

Break the journey up into:
* points of interest
* legs of travel

#### Legs of travel

Follow the steps:
* Frame the action: where they find themsleves, how long have they been travelling
* Describe the environment: give 3 impressions from different senses; things they see, hear, smell, or feel; the travel almanac has examples
* Ask questions: ask the characters questions about the terrain or what it's like to travel through it; suggest that they Keep Company
    * Questions are listed on the GM cheatsheet
* Portray NPCs: describe what they're up to, what they're talking about, how they're reacting to this leg of travel
* Add details, answer questions, clarify the situation: elaborate as much or as little as your player interest demands
* Make a soft GM move:
    * Present one of the challenges you listed when they Charted a Course
    * Present an encounter from your prep
    * Have an NPC or follower get into or start some trouble
    * Stir up conflict between the PCs
    * Offer them an opportunity to do something as they travel, or else to arrive at the next point of interest
    * Use your exploration moves
* Resolve their actions
* Repeat

#### Points of interest

Points of interest:
* a landmark that has not yet been seen in play (or that has changed since the PC's last visit)
* a specific place where you plan to frame a scene and make a GM move
* the journey's destination

Follow the steps:
* Frame the action: arrive at it or establish tension by having them observe it from a distance
* Describe the environment
    * What makes it distinct from the surrounding terrain?
    * What are its obvious, defining features?
    * Give 3 impressions from different senses; things they see, hear, smell, or feel; the travel almanac has examples
        * Any scene: light, visibility, space, anything constant and unignorable (wind, rain, heat, cold, sound of a stream, etc.).
        * Social scenes: the people present, details that reflect their physical or emotional state, their attitudes, the "feel" of the place.
        * Exploration scenes: footing, line of sight, likely paths, details that tell the place's story and reflect what has happened here.
        * Action scenes: dangers of course, but also footing, clearance, distance, obstacles, line of sight, relative positions, momentum, things to knock over/fall from/burn, etc.
* Ask questions
    * Questions are listed on the GM cheatsheet
* Portray NPCs: describe what they're up to, what they're talking about, how they're reacting
* Add details, answer questions, clarify the situation: elaborate as much or as little as your player interest demands
* Make a soft GM move
    * GM moves are listed on the GM cheatsheet.
    * If nothing else, offer them an opportunity.
    * Use your exploration moves.
* Resolve their actions
* Repeat

See [Expeditions](BookOne\07Expeditions).  

### Keeping fights interesting

Fights should be interesting, dynamic and tense. Don't let it devolve to trading blows.  

Make soft GM moves all the time: raise tension and provoke action.  
Make your moves, especially monster moves, colorful, descriptive and specific.  
Demand the same from your players.  
Consider the momentum of the action and fictional positioning. Incorporate it into descriptions and actions.  

Vary your GM moves: don't always hurt them or put them on the spot.  
Respect the fiction of the attack.  
Keep in mind what other foes are doing.  
Keep the spotlight moving.  
Give less-combat oriented characters opportunities to shine, discoveries, puzzles and fragile treasures.  
Incorporate the environment: lighting, weather, visibility, fog of war.  
Populate your battlefields with potential enegy: things to knock over, high places to fall off, kindling to start a blaze.  
Use active hazards too: blazing buildings, crumbling ceilings, ...  
Recap and summarize the situation regurarly.  
End fights earlier rather then later.  

See [Dangers](BookOne\08Dangers).  

### Burden of leadership

Followers are useful, but they are also a source of stress and conflict.  
Followers get scared, freeze up when surprised, flee from a terryfing foe or panic in the face of a supernatural horror.  

Loyalty can be spent to overcome these limitations.  
If Loyalty isn't spend, make the PC convience them or resist freezing up or panicing.  

Followers won't do what they are told if:
* they’re angry, miserable, shocked, or otherwise overwhelmed
* the order is unreasonable, foolish, degrading, distasteful, etc.
* the order goes against the follower’s instinct, tags, cost, or other traits

Play up a follower’s instinct, tags, and traits as a source of trouble for the PCs.  
Emphasizing a follower’s fear, foibles, and troublesome behaviors makes their Loyalty valuable.  

See [Dangers](BookOne\09NPCsAndFollowers).
