### NPCs

Anything that isn't a PC. This includes ouls of the departed and animals too.

### Followers

Followers are NPCs who generally take orders from a PC and follower their lead.  
GM ultimately decides what happens with them. However:  
* they generally do what their PC say
* Loyalty makes them easier to manage
* they trigger a move when a PC has them do something

Followers get stats just like monsters. However they also have:
* cost: what keeps them following a PC
* Loyalty: spend for a follower to ignore fear, behave themselves or to do somthing they'd rather not

### Follower moves

Triggered when a follower acts on the PCs behest.  
Loyalty makes convincing followers easier, but insane actions still require convincing.  
Add +0 as default, +1 if a follower is good at it and has a tag that indicates that and if they are exceptional and have a tag that applies, yo uadd +2.  
Roll with disadvantage if a tag hinders a move.  
Resolve follower actions with as few rolls as possible.  

Paying a follower's cost should be a meaningful moment.  
Loyalty isn't just transactional. It represents trust, fondness, respect or just habit.  
Ask the PC what it looks like when they spend Loyalty.  

### Followers in play

GM is responsible for potraying them.  
Include followers in the core loop.  
Generally follower do what the PC tells them to do and look for direction from the PC.  
Moves only trigger when a PC orders or directs a follower.  

#### Burden of leadership

Followers are useful, but they are also a source of stress and conflict.  
Followers get scared, freeze up when surprised, flee from a terryfing foe or panic in the face of a supernatural horror.  

Loyalty can be spent to overcome these limitations.  
If Loyalty isn't spend, make the PC convience them or resist freezing up or panicing.  

Followers won't do what they are told if:
* they’re angry, miserable, shocked, or otherwise overwhelmed
* the order is unreasonable, foolish, degrading, distasteful, etc.
* the order goes against the follower’s instinct, tags, cost, or other traits

Play up a follower’s instinct, tags, and traits as a source of trouble for the PCs.  
Emphasizing a follower’s fear, foibles, and troublesome behaviors makes their Loyalty valuable.  

#### Off-screne orders

Resolve it with a single roll at the most tense and relevant point.  

#### Followers in fights

They look for orders from the PC, but they don't just stand by.  
Clear communication is difficult during a fight.  

#### Followers at 0 HP

Let things burn.  

#### Group followers

Like Marshal's crew.  
They all share common stats, but have individual HP pools.
