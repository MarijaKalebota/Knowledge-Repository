## First Adventure

### Goals

* Paint a picture of daily life: pictures of their home, mundane life, a home worth fighting for
* Explore relationships: push NPCs and their relationships into the spotlight
* Identify what's important to them: 
* Push them into the field: don't let the village itself be a major source of conflict, at least not at first
* Establish details, but leave blanks: be asking questions like crazy
* Play up both the mundane and the mysterious: have a bit of both
* Draw them back home: encourage them to go home  

### Structure

1) Start with the setup, in which you ask a bunch of loaded questions that provide context and establish motivation

2) Then set the scene, zooming in on a particular place and time in the village.

3) Once the scene is established, drop the hook. Shows signs of trouble, reveal an unwelcome truth, offer an opportunity, tell them the consequences, etc.

4) They'll make preparations: Chart a Course, Outfit, Requisition and recruit followers to join them

5) They will likely travel towards the focal point of the adventure. The journey will likely be an adventure itself.

6) The journey leads them to the resolution of the adventure

7) Then there's the aftermath: the journey home, the triumphant (or notso) return, the reactions of their friends, family, and neighbors, and a return to day-to-day life

If they get distracted or don't take the hook, that's fine. Follow the GM principles and keep asking what they do.  

### Background

A good first adventure requires preparation. At the very least, you should:
* Identify the central threat or opportunity
* Write up your threat(s)
* Plan your hook

#### Identify the central threat or opportunity

Depends on what they rolled on spring breaks forth and what they chose.  

##### On a 10+, an opportunity

The opportunity should be both:
* external, so as to get the PCs out of the steading
* nearby, within a few days of Stonetop, so that they can get there and back with a modest amount of rations

##### On a 7-9, a threat and a gain

##### On a 6-, threats abound

#### Write up your Threats

Write them up if your initial adventure involves a threat. See later chapters on how to do it.  

Try to come up with an impending doom, and make the first grim portent the hook for your first adventure.  
Write up any related threats, or at least assign them a threat type and instinct.

#### Refine your hook

Firm up the details, but only give answers in general terms:
* What exactly is going to happen?
* When will this happen?
* Where?
* Who will be involved?
* Who will witness it and what will they report?

Make sure the hook is:
* is actionable, giving the PCs some chance to actually do something about it
and implying an obvious first step for them to take
* involves all of the PCs
* communicates urgency, making it clear that if the PCs just sit on their hands, something bad will happen or an opportunity will be missed

### Setup questions

Before you set your first scene, ask a bunch of loaded questions.  

#### Establish key details

* What details need to be established before you start play?
* What needs to be true for your hook to make sense?
* What obvious questions arise as you think about those things?

#### Highlight relevant setting elements

#### Foreshadow

#### Make things personal

Ask questions of each player.  
Try to balance how much you are asking each player.  
Ask the questions in such a way that:
* they presume the characterâ€™s direct involvement
* the player is telling you what their character believes or has heard, rather than what they know

### Setting the scene

Your goal is to establish what mundane, daily life looks like.  

Work backwards from the hook:
* What time of day will the hook happen?
* What do you want to be happening in town?
* Where will the hook drop?
* Where should the PCs be when it does?

Ask questions that establish details and explore daily life:
* What are you doing?
* Who's with you?
* What are you eating?
* What are you looking forward to?
* Whose eye do you hope to catch?

Spend some time making homefront moves:
* Introduce someone
* Reveal simmering tensions
* Present a want or need
* Remind them of their obligations
* Quicken a threat or crisis
* Oppose their wishes
* Play them against each other
* Change a relationship
* Show them how others really feel

### Dropping the hook

Make GM moves that introduce the core threat or opportunity of the adventure and prompt the PCs to act.  

### Heading out

#### Preparations

They'll often trigger:
* Chart a Course, in which they tell you where they plan to go and you tell them what's involved in getting there.
* Outfit, in which they "gear up" for the expedition.
* Requisition, in which they might borrow town assets (like horses or carts).

#### Travel

This involves:
* presenting legs of travel and points of interest, describing the environment and the weather
* asking lots of questions, like, "What's the worst about slogging through these hills?" or "What do the old-timers say about this place?"
* making GM moves, like having their followers cause or get into trouble, providing a choice of paths, presenting the challenges that you outlined when they Charted a Course, and introducing other dangers and discoveries
* asking "What do you do?"
* resolving PC's actions
