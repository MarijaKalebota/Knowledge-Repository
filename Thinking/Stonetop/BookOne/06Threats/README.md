## Threats

A threat is an ongoing problem that will cause trouble for the PCs if left unchecked. It has to be worsening or an recurring issue. Don’t bother writing up a threat unless you know it’s going to be a big deal.  

### When to write up threats

* After introduction
* When Seasons Change
* After a session
* When preparing an adventure

### Writing a threat

1) Give the threat a name and type.
2) Give it an instinct, if it doesn't already have one.
3) Write a quick description, including related threats and NPCs.
4) If it has momentum: write out its impending doom and grim portents.
5) Optional: write some stakes questions.
6) Optional: pick or write GM moves to further define its behavior/capabilities.
7) Optional: write custom player moves.

#### 1) Name and type

* Afflication: circumstances, or conditions that make people suffer, bring them into conflict, or just make them worry and fret.
* Beast: monsters, animals, or NPCs driven by basic need and instinct.
* Institution: people, groups, or positions that have power
* MacGuffin: objects, places, even secrets that stir up conflict
* Magical entity: spirits, many fae, the Things Below, even gods or their agents
* Rabble: group, with or without a leader, united by emotion, blood, or circumstance rather then any goal or purpose
* Villain: individuals with the ruthlessness, drive, and power to make life awful for any number of other people
* Wildcard: individuals who cause trouble because they're a mystery or because a NPC is a threat but doesn't fit any other threat

#### 2) Threat tracker

#### 3) Instinct

Write up an instinct: primary behavior that makes it a problem, that causes it to come into conflict with or harm others.

#### 4) Description

Describe it:
* Who or what the threat is.
* How it came to be a problem for the PCs, or how they first encountered it.
* Its relationship(s) to NPCs, monsters, points of interest, or other threats.

When you realize that a threat contains sub-threats:
* fully write up that other threat, as its own entry on the threat tracker and in your notes
* pick a type and instinct for the lesser threat, and include them (in parentheses) as part of the main threat's description

#### 5) Impending doom and grim portents

Add the impending doom:
* what irrevocable bad thing that will happen if it proceeds unchecked?

Add grim portents:
* 2-4 milestones, steps along the way that will demonstrate the threat's progression
* concrete, observable things PCs can react to and possibly prevent

#### 6) Stakes

Add stakes:
* Ask yourself some questions about the threat and the people affected by it.
* What do you wonder about?
* What do you want to discover in play?

#### 7) GM moves

If you want to further define how the threat behaves or what it's capable of, pick or write 2-4 GM moves.  

#### 8) Player moves

Sometimes a threat will suggest a unique player-facing move, one that's only triggered when interacting with the threat, its minions, or its domain.
