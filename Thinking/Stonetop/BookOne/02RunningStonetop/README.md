## Running Stonetop

Remember: the game is a conversation.  
The game's rules kick in at particular moments.  

The GM:
* describes the world, says what happens and portrays monsters and NPCs
* facilitates and makes rulings
* asks for input
* frames scenes
* points the spotlight

### Your agenda

GM goals:
* Portray a rich and mysterious world:
    * Mundane concerns — crops, trade, weather, the opinions of your neighbors — are important.
    * Fantastic elements are important, too, but they are strange and scary and poorly understood. The past sleeps unquietly. Questions abound.
* Punctuate the characters' lives with adventure: PCs have lives to live, homes to take care of, families to feed. They have demands on their time. Your job is to make that stuff matter, but also to interrupt it with threats and opportunities
* Play to find out what happens

Everything you do should support one of these goals. If it doesn't, than do something else.

### The core loop

1) Establish the situation

* Frame the action
* Describe the environment
* Give details and specifics
* Ask questions, ask for input
* Portray NPCs and monsters
* Answer questions, clarify

2) Make a soft GM move

* Provoke action and/or increase tension.

3) Ask "What do you do?"

4) Resolve their actions

* If they trigger a player move, do what the move says.
* If they roll a 6- or they ignore trouble, make a hard GM move (establish badness).
* Otherwise, say what happens.

5) Repeat

* Is the situation clear and grabby? Can the PC(s) act? Back to step 3.
* Is the situation clear, but escalating before the PCs act? Back to step 2.
* Is the situation clear, but needs a nudge? Back to step 2.
* Is the situation unclear? Does it need recapping or updating? Back to step 1.
* Is the current scene or situation over? Wrap up, look for the next one. Back to step 1.

#### Establish the situation

* Frame the action: establish who, when and where; PC/NPC, place and time
* Describe the environment: 3 strong impressions
    * Senses like smell, sound or sight
    * Emotions like grief or tension 
    * Morality like dirty and desperate next to well-fed gentry
    * Focus on what matters
* Give details and specifics: it'll give the situation texture; what's happening, who is doing what, where is everyone relative to everyone else, what can you sense
* Ask questions, ask for input
    * Don't ask them to make up key details
    * Prompt them for a detail that fits a theme
    * Ask what they are feeling or experiencing or what they are doing or what they are thinking about
* Portray NPCs and monsters
    * NPCs: describe them, what they are doing, how thy are reacting, speak in their voice
    * Monsters: desribe them, their size, movement, sounds, smells, what they are focused on
* Answer questions, clarify: be honest and generous with truth and details; if the answer isn't clear to the PCs, tell them how they can find out

#### Make a soft GM move

It should either:
* Provoke action
    * Something bad is about to ahppen or in the process of happening, but PCs have a chance to react to it
    * Offer an opportunity or present options and prompt them to pick
    * In social scenes NPCs can say something vulnerable or emotional and look to a PC for a reaction
* Increase tension
    * Use up their stuff, foreshadow trouble or add trouble that can't be acted on right away

#### "What do you do?"

#### Resolve their action

##### Hard GM moves

Make it when a PC:
* ignores a threat or trouble entirely; or
* triggers a move but rolls a 6-

Establish badness:
* Describe consequences
* Say how things went wrong
* Make the situation significantly worse

It doesn't always mean that the PC has failed.  
The badness might not even be directly connected to the action they took — it could simply follow directly on its heels.  

A hard move should always establish badness, but you decide just how bad it is.  
Use the situation, the fiction, the description of the player’s actions, and so forth to inform your hard moves.  
Sometimes, a hard move isn’t much worse than a soft one.  

#### Repeat

### The spotlight

Whoever you're talking to right now is in the spotlight.

Move the spotlight:
* after you resolve a PC's action - then make a soft GM move on a different character and talk to them
* when a player freezes or stalls; resolve it later
* when the PC does something that will take time
* when they make a move and you're not sure how to resolve it; buy time by shifting to a different PC, then come back and resolve the move

### Scenes and loose play

Scenes are zoomed-in.  

Good scenes have a purpose:
* What are the PCs trying to accomplish?
* What are you trying to convey?
* What questions are you hoping to answer?
If a scene has no purpose, skip it!    

Loose play is what happens between scenes.  

Push loose play towards scenes.  

### Your GM moves

Your GM moves should inspire and empower you; they shouldn't constrain you. Don't stress if your move isn't on the list.  

* Announce trouble (future or offscreen)
    * Soft - provoke reaction, create worry or crank up the tension
    * Hard - turn a peaceful scene into a fight or conflict or make it clear that there will be strong consequences later
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
    * Soft - great for Know Things or Seek Insight, the answer is honest or interesting, but they don't have to be happy about it
    * Hard - let them know a bad thing is true; twist the screws
* Ask a provocative question
    * Soft - ask the player a question that spurs a decision or response
    * Hard - ask the player to author badness you asserted through the question
* Put someone in a spot
    * More aggressive Announcing trouble - do something now or it'll get ugly
* Use up their resources
    * Can be items, supplies, ammo, reputation, trust, loyalty, HP or similar
    * Make it together with other GM Moves
* Turn their move back on them
    * Hard - flip the Move on them
* Demonstrate a downside
    * Show the Move's limit or baggage or item's tag effect
* Hurt someone
    * More than losing HP: inflict a wound or problematic injury or debility based on tags, damage and fiction
    * Announce permanent, disabling injuries before inflicting them
* Separate them
    * Split the party by putting obstacles or foes between them
* Capture someone
    * Soft - capture, but give a chance to react
    * Hard - cut to them being bound, captured, dragged off
* Offer an opportunity (with or without a cost)
    * Give them an opening, a chance to act
* Tell them the consequences/requirements
    * Use as an interrupt, to clarify, to set the stakes or force meaningful a decision or give a path forward or to make them pay to take an action
* Advance towards impending doom
    * Show that a grim portent of a hazard or threat has come to pass

### Your principles

* Follow the rules
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Address the characters, not the players
* Ask questions and build on the answers:
    * establish intent
    * clarify intent
    * clarify the fiction
    * ask the characters what they are thinking or feeling
    * ask about their past or their day to day lives
    * ask things they would know
    * about what they have heard or believe
    * ask questions that assert details while asking for input
    * ask the characters to paint the scene for you
* Be a fan of the player characters
* Embrace the fantastic and the mundane: if the focus is on the mundane, add a dash of the fantastic and vice-versa
* Exploit the setting guide
* Respect your prep
* Bring your characters to life
* Think offscreen, too
* Bring it home: make the village the foundation, let them make improvements and put down threats, show how the neighbours, far and near, react, during adventure ask questions about their lives in the village, talk about how they are greeted when they return and about their daily lives
* Let things breathe: avoid following the PCs day to day, hour to hour, allow straches of time to pass between adventures
* Let things burn: play to find out what happens, nothing is sacred, protect no one and nothing

### Other things to do

* Takes notes: NPC names, historical notes, interesting details, summary of events
* Draw maps: and lots of them
* Leave blanks: leave blanks in your maps, wonder about things, leave questions unanswered
* Keep things moving: keep up the momentum, frame sceens agressively, skip ahead or make a GM move
* Involve everyone
* Take breaks
* Engage players in worldbuilding
* Sometimes, disclaim descision making: put the outcome in the PCs hands, discuss and outcome or let the dice decide

#### What not to do

* Plan a storyline or plot
* Tell them to roll before they tell you want they are doing
* Tell them to roll just because
* Stop making GM moves

### GMing is a practice

Even if you are experienced running Dungeon World, you may need to unlearn certain habits.  

Ask players for feedback:
* what did they enjoy?
* what felt rocky?
* what do you want to see more next session?

Ask for clarification if you need it, but don't get defensive and don't try to explain yourself.  
Try to be humble and receptive.  

After each session:
* Review your agenda:
    * Did the world feel flat, hollow, arbitrary?
    * Did you let things drag?
    * Did you force things down the path that you thought they should go?
    * What would pursuing my agenda have looked like? Do that next time!
* Review your principles:
    * Did you ever fail to follow them?
    * How did it impact the game?
    * What would following the principle have looked like instead? Do that next time!
* When were you stumped as to what to do next?
    * Where were you in the loop when you got stuck?
    * What could you have done differently?
    * What sort of prep might have helped? Prep more of that!
* Did you miss to trigger certain moves?
    * Did you miss any moves getting triggered?
    * Did you call for a player move, even though its trigger wasn't really met?

### Prep

* To give you interesting stuff to say
* To speed up play, and not make everyone wait while you decide what happens
* To shore up your weaknesses; if you always forget about the PCs' followers, prep what they might do or say
* To hone your craft, make it more consistent or thematic, it flows better, it builds on stuff that came up earlier
* To give yourself permission to play hard and visit badness on the PCs
* Prep only as much as you find useful and valuable

Consider prepping:
* Threats: ongoing, recurring problems that cause trouble for the PCs, things that are going to get worse if left unchecked
* Hooks: when you want to push the PCs into the field with a threat or an opportunity
* Expeditions: prepare your choices for the Chart a Course move; drawing a map, prepping points of interest and roughly imagining a few encounters
* Locations: important place you expect the PCs to explore or encounter during a session. What's it like? How will you describe it? What questions will you ask about it? What's its story? Do you need a map or a visual aid? Are there dangers or discoveries within?
* Dangers: hazards and monsters and hostile NPCs
* Discoveries: puzzles, clues, mysteries, treasures, arcana
* NPCs: think about their names, the questions you'll ask about them, their defining traits, how you'll describe them and potray them

It doesn't go against playing to find out what happens.  
You're prepping things that give you interesting stuff to say.  
Prepping involves laying a groundwork to help you improvise.
