## Running Stonetop

Remember: the game is a conversation.  
The game's rules kick in at particular moments.  

The GM:
* describes the world, says what happens and portrays monsters and NPCs
* facilitates and makes rulings
* asks for input
* frames scenes
* points the spotlight

### Your agenda

GM goals:
* Portray a rich and mysterious world
* Punctuate the characters' lives with adventure
* Play to find out what happens

### The core loop

1) Establish the situation

* Frame the action
* Describe the environment
* Give details and specifics
* Ask questions, ask for input
* Portray NPCs and monsters
* Answer questions, clarify

2) Make a soft GM move

* Provoke action and/or increase tension.

3) Ask "What do you do?"

4) Resolve their actions

* If they trigger a player move, do what the move says.
* If they roll a 6- or they ignore trouble, make a hard GM move (establish badness).
* Otherwise, say what happens.

5) Repeat

* Is the situation clear and grabby? Can the PC(s) act? Back to step 3.
* Is the situation clear, but escalating before the PCs act? Back to step 2.
* Is the situation clear, but needs a nudge? Back to step 2.
* Is the situation unclear? Does it need recapping or updating? Back to step 1.
* Is the current scene or situation over? Wrap up, look for the next one. Back to step 1.

#### Establish the situation

* Frame the action: who?, when?, where?
* Describe the environment: 3 strong impressions, smell, sound, sight, focusing on what matters
* Give details and specifics: it'll give the situation texture
* Ask questions, ask for input: don't ask them to make up details, but what they are feeling or experiencing or what they are doing or what they are thinking about
* Portray NPCs and monsters
* Answer questions, clarify

#### Make a soft GM move

Offer an opportunity or present options and prompt them to pick.  

#### "What do you do?"

#### Resolve their action

##### Hard GM moves

Make it when a PC:
* ignores a threat or trouble entirely; or
* triggers a move but rolls a 6-

You are establishing badness.  
It doesn't always mean that the PC has failed.  

#### Repeat

### The spotlight

Whoever you're talking to right now is in the spotlight.

The most obvious time to move the spotlight is after you resolve a PC's action.

### Scenes and loose play

### Your GM moves

Your GM moves should inspire and empower you; they shouldn't constrain you. Don't stress if your move isn't on the list.  

* Announce trouble (future or offscreen)
* Reveal an unwelcome truth
* Ask a provocative question
* Put someone in a spot
* Use up their resources
* Turn their move back on them
* Demonstrate a downside
* Hurt someone: problematic injury or wound a PC or an NPC they care about, something more than just losing HP; take tags and the amount of damage into account; telegraph or demonstrate the danger if you are going to inflict a permanent debilitating wound
* Separate them
* Capture someone
* Offer an opportunity (with or without a cost)
* Tell them the consequences/requirements (then ask)
* Advance a countdown/grim portent

### Your principles

* Follow the rules
* Begin and end with the fiction
* Address the characters, not the players
* Ask questions and build on the answers:
    * establish intent
    * clarify intent
    * clarify the fiction
    * ask the characters what they are thinking or feeling
    * ask about their past or their day to day lives
    * ask things they would know
    * about what they have heard or believe
    * ask questions that assert details while asking for input
    * ask the characters to paint the scene for you
* Be a fan of the player characters
* Embrace the fantastic and the mundane: if the focus is on the mundane, add a dash of the fantastic and vice-versa
* Exploit the setting guide
* Respect your prep
* Bring your characters to life
* Think offscreen, too
* Bring it home: make the village the foundation, let them make improvements and put down threats, show how the neighbours, far and near, react, during adventure ask questions about their lives in the village, talk about how they are greeted when they return and about their daily lives
* Let things breathe: avoid following the PCs day to day, hour to hour, allow straches of time to pass between adventures
* Let things burn: play to find out what happens, nothing is sacred, protect no one and nothing

### Other things to do

* Takes notes
* Draw maps
* Leave blanks
* Keep things moving
* Involve everyone
* Take breaks
* Engage players in worldbuilding
* Sometimes, disclaim descision making

#### What not to do

* Plan a storyline or plot
* Tell them to roll before they tell you want they are doing
* Tell them to roll just because
* Stop making GM moves

### GMing is a practice

Even if you are experienced running Dungeon World, you may need to unlearn certain habits.  

Ask players for feedback:
* what did they enjoy?
* what felt rocky?
* what do you want to see more next session?

Ask for clarification if you need it, but don't get defensive and don't try to explain yourself.  
Try to be humble and receptive.  

After each session:
* Review your agenda:
    * Did the world feel flat, hollow, arbitrary?
    * Did you let things drag?
    * Did you force things down the path that you thought they should go?
    * What would pursuing my agenda have looked like? Do that next time!
* Review your principles:
    * Did you ever fail to follow them?
    * How did it impact the game?
    * What would following the principle have looked like instead? Do that next time!
* When were you stumped as to what to do next?
    * Where were you in the loop when you got stuck?
    * What could you have done differently?
    * What sort of prep might have helped? Prep more of that!
* Did you miss to trigger certain moves?
    * Did you miss any moves getting triggered?
    * Did you call for a player move, even though its trigger wasn't really met?

### Prep

* To give you interesting stuff to say
* To speed up play, and not make everyone wait while you decide what happens
* To shore up your weaknesses; if you always forget about the PCs' followers, prep what they might do or say
* To hone your craft, make it more consistent or thematic, it flows better, it builds on stuff that came up earlier
* To give yourself permission to play hard and visit badness on the PCs
* Prep only as much as you find useful and valuable

Consider prepping:
* Threats: ongoing, recurring problems that cause trouble for the PCs, things that are going to get worse if left unchecked
* Hooks: when you want to push the PCs into the field with a threat or an opportunity
* Expeditions: prepare your choices for the Chart a Course move; drawing a map, prepping points of interest and roughly imagining a few encounters
* Locations: important place you expect the PCs to explore or encounter during a session. What's it like? How will you describe it? What questions will you ask about it? What's its story? Do you need a map or a visual aid? Are there dangers or discoveries within?
* Dangers: hazards and monsters and hostile NPCs
* Discoveries: puzzles, clues, mysteries, treasures, arcana
* NPCs: think about their names, the questions you'll ask about them, their defining traits, how you'll describe them and potray them

It doesn't go against playing to find out what happens.  
You're prepping things that give you interesting stuff to say.  
Prepping involves laying a groundwork to help you improvise.
