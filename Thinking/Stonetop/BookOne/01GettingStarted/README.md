## Getting Started

### Get ready

Concept: play a group of heroes if s small isolated village.  

Read Setting Overview first.  

Character creation chould be done as a group, discourage anyone from making decisions before the session.  

Go through these documents:
* Setting Overview
* Steading playbook
* Moves and Gear
* A few class playbooks to get a sense of what they are about
* Arcana, Major and Minor
* if time permits, go through this book and Setting Guide

There's nothing secret in any of the documents. 

### Review the setting

Ask everyone to take 10-15 minutes to read the Setting Overview handout.

Ask the group what questions they have.

Ask everyone what they find intriguing or exciting. What catches their imagination and makes them want to learn more?  
Take notes! Be sure to include these topics in the game.  

### Set expectations

Ask everyone if they’re comfortable with the players' agenda and principles.

Emphasize the importance of collaboration.  

Make it clear that you’ll be fleshing out the world together.

There are no official answers to many of the questions raised by the Setting Guide. There are many blanks to fill in. You (the GM) have a setting guide, but it’s mostly filled with ideas rather than truths.  

### Discuss tone and content

-

### Create characters

Ask each player to work through their playbook from front to back, making choices and filling in blanks as needed.  

### Introduce the PCs

Everyone should stop and wait at the Introductions section of their playbooks, which comprises the second column on the back page.  

Set expectations: they’ll take turns introducing themselves, adding details, asking and answering questions about each other and the setting as it develops through conversation.

* Pay attention: take interest in what everyone else says.  
* Ask and answer questions: if they want to know more about something that comes up, ask. Answer questions asked of you honestly.  
* Play off of each other: incorporate details mentioned by others into your own contributions.  

Give each NPC a name, occupation and trait.  

Take notes. Ask questions.  

### Let sprint break forth

End the session with Seasons Change move on the Moves & Gear handout. Note the result.  

Ask what excites you the most about playing your character?

### After the session

You have notes about:
* NPCs
* relationships
* events
* details

#### Organize your notes

Update:
* residents and NPCs
* notable neighbours

Make a relationship map: characters are vertices and edges are relationships.  

Create a timeline.  

If there are contradictions in your notes, resolve them with players or make a call.  

Spot and update connections.  
If you think there might be a connection, write it under "I wonder...".  

Share the NPC list and timeline with your players.  

#### Identify threats

Look for sources of trouble or ongoing problems for the PCs or the village.   
If a threat is implied, write it under "I wonder...".   

#### I wonder...

A running list of open questions, things that you wonder about but:
* you don't know how to ansswer
* you want to leave unanswered for now and see it get answered through play

During prep use it to:
* identify the adventure's central opportunity or threat
* help write the setup questions that you'll ask the characters

During session use it to say something interesting.
Can you say something that answers one of these questions?
Or that hints at the answer?
Can you turn one of these questions back on the characters, and ask them to give you the answers?
