### After the session

You have:
* NPCs
* relationships
* events
* details

#### Organize your notes

Update:
* residents and NPCs
* notable neighbours

Perhaps you could make a relationship map: characters are vertices and edges are relationships.  

Create a timeline.  

If there are contradictions in your notes, resolve them.  

Spot and update connections.  
If you think there might be a connection, write it under "I wonder...".  

Share the NPC list and timeline with your players.  

#### Identify threats

Look for sources of trouble or ongoing problems for the PCs or the village.   
If a threat is implied, write it under "I wonder...".   

#### I wonder...

A running list of open questions, things that you wonder about but:
* you don't know how to ansswer
* you want to leave unanswered for now and see it get answered through play

Use the list to help identify:
* the adventure's central opportunity or threat
* help write the setup questions that you'll ask the characters

Refer to this list when you need something interesting to say.
