## Dangers

* Hazards: environmental dangers
* Dangers: active, with intent, adversaries

### Hazards

Improvised.  

### Monsters

#### Creating monsters

#### Running monster and combat

Monsters have personalitites:
* pattern of behavior
* an instinct
* sense of self-preservation
* wants, needs, fears or weaknesses

Hint at their inner life and motives.  
Play up the tension, the fear, the bloody consequences.  
Make your monsters scary.  
Let things burn, don't pull punches.  

##### Introducing monsters

Worry only about your monsters making sense, not if they are balanced or fair fights.  

##### The flow of combat

Make soft GM moves.  
Usually you describe an attack just short of connecting.  
Keep everyone involved and move the spotlight.  

Make a PC suffer an attack when:
* you set it up with a soft GM move
* the move says so
* on a 6- reguardless of which move fails

Suffering an attack doesn't mean PCs take damage, but you may hurt them.  
Be informed by fictional positioning to reduce or increase the badness of a 6-.  

Avoid anything that feels like grinding down HP or trading blows.  
Use GM moves to constantly shift the momentum of the fight and the fictional positioning.  

Some monsters will try to escape.  

##### Foes they can't hurt

Convey how immpossible and difficult it will be to fight it.  
These foes don't trigger Clash or Let Fly. Make soft GM moves instead.  
Reward creativity and effort. Be a fan of the characters, but also respect your prep and don't pull punches.  

##### Multiple combatants

Break up the action into multiple smaller ones.  
Unpinned and unengaged foes can cause trouble for the PCs.  
Be more aggrassive with your GM moves when a PC or follower is engaged with multiple foes.  
For area of effect attack you roll once for the move, but once for each foe hit. Tactics can mae a big difference, like holding a chokepoint or attacking a flank.  

##### Abstracting groups

Groups are abstracted into a single move.  
Add +X Armour and +X damage for each 1:X ration to the side that outnumbers the other.  
Here, damage represent casualties.  

##### Keeping fights interesting

Fights should be interesting, dynamic and tense. Don't let it devolve to trading blows.  

Make soft GM moves all the time: raise tension and provoke action.  
Make your moves, especially monster moves, colorful, descriptive and specific.  
Demand the same from your players.  
Consider the momentum of the action and fictional positioning. Incorporate it into descriptions and actions.  

Vary your GM moves: don't always hurt them or put them on the spot.  
Respect the fiction of the attack.  
Keep in mind what other foes are doing.  
Keep the spotlight moving.  
Give less-combat oriented characters opportunities to shine, discoveries, puzzles and fragile treasures.  
Incorporate the environment: lighting, weather, visibility, fog of war.  
Populate your battlefields with potential enegy: things to knock over, high places to fall off, kindling to start a blaze.  
Use active hazards too: blazing buildings, crumbling ceilings, ...  
Recap and summarize the situation regurarly.  
End fights earlier rather then later.
