## Expeditions

Travel is an important. Don't gloss over it.  
It is a chance to flesh out and explore the winder world and reinforce the relative safety of their Steading.  

### Preparations

#### Chart a Course

* Clarify destination and route; if they don't know, use Know Things
* Tell them as many of the requirements based on: the seasons, the terrain, how well they know the area, the dangers that lurk there, the threats you've established and their grim portents

Requiremants are all listed on a GM cheatsheet.  

If you choose "First you must travel to," then Chart a Course for each leg of the journey. You can nest this requirement two or three levels deep.  

Remind the PCs of the requirements or show them the consequences of not meeting them.  

#### ... a corresponding amount of supplies

They represent stuff that the PCs might need or want on an expedition: food, water, whisky, bandages, salves, ...

Supplies get used when:
* they Recover, Make Camp or Have What They Need
* you use up their resources, and supplies are what you use up

Each person uses one supply per day, unless you use a mess kit then one supply feeds four people.  
Pack animals graze, small pets don't eat much but other pets probably eat from the party supplies.  

#### Outfit

Decise the load: light, medium or heavy.  
Small Items don't count as load.  
Have What You Need move gives them items.  

Followers need to Outfit too! Either you or the palyers decide.  

Ask questions about what they bring and maybe even have a little scene.  

#### Requisition

For when PCs want to take communal assets.  

Who are they asking for permission?
Who should they ask? Who has the right to say "yes?"
Who's doing the asking, and how?

Sometimes, taking Surplus may also trigger the move if they are doing something wasteful or overly risky.  

If they take it by force, sneaking or without permission, reduce Fortunes by one.  
The same is true if they fail to return the asset they borrowed: reduce Fortune by one.  

#### Other preparations

Zoom in and out of scenes and loose play.  
They might not have enough time to Trade and Barter.  
Let them do research, but if they dawdl tell them the requirements and consequences.  
Followers, including Marshal's Crew, will join the expedition unless the mission if fulish or against the goals of the followers.  
If PCs seek followers, offer an opportunity or introduce someone through Know Things, Seek Insight or Persuade. Candidates can come from a Muster too.  
Followers also Outfit.  

#### Flashbacks

Allow it only if it doesn't contradict what already happened.  

### Running the journey

Break the journey up into:
* points of interest
* legs of travel

#### Legs of travel

Follow the steps:
* Frame the action: where they find themsleves, how long have they been travelling
* Describe the environment: give 3 impressions from different senses; things they see, hear, smell, or feel; the travel almanac has examples
* Ask questions: ask the characters questions about the terrain or what it's like to travel through it; suggest that they Keep Company
    * Questions are listed on the GM cheatsheet
* Portray NPCs: describe what they're up to, what they're talking about, how they're reacting to this leg of travel
* Add details, answer questions, clarify the situation: elaborate as much or as little as your player interest demands
* Make a soft GM move:
    * Present one of the challenges you listed when they Charted a Course
    * Present an encounter from your prep
    * Have an NPC or follower get into or start some trouble
    * Stir up conflict between the PCs
    * Offer them an opportunity to do something as they travel, or else to arrive at the next point of interest
    * Use your exploration moves
* Resolve their actions
* Repeat

#### Points of interest

Points of interest:
* a landmark that has not yet been seen in play (or that has changed since the PC's last visit)
* a specific place where you plan to frame a scene and make a GM move
* the journey's destination

Follow the steps:
* Frame the action: arrive at it or establish tension by having them observe it from a distance
* Describe the environment
    * What makes it distinct from the surrounding terrain?
    * What are its obvious, defining features?
    * Give 3 impressions from different senses; things they see, hear, smell, or feel; the travel almanac has examples
        * Any scene: light, visibility, space, anything constant and unignorable (wind, rain, heat, cold, sound of a stream, etc.).
        * Social scenes: the people present, details that reflect their physical or emotional state, their attitudes, the "feel" of the place.
        * Exploration scenes: footing, line of sight, likely paths, details that tell the place's story and reflect what has happened here.
        * Action scenes: dangers of course, but also footing, clearance, distance, obstacles, line of sight, relative positions, momentum, things to knock over/fall from/burn, etc.
* Ask questions
    * Questions are listed on the GM cheatsheet
* Portray NPCs: describe what they're up to, what they're talking about, how they're reacting
* Add details, answer questions, clarify the situation: elaborate as much or as little as your player interest demands
* Make a soft GM move
    * GM moves are listed on the GM cheatsheet.
    * If nothing else, offer them an opportunity.
    * Use your exploration moves.
* Resolve their actions
* Repeat

#### Exploration moves

* Provide a choice of paths: make the choice meaningful
* Hint at more than meets the eye: something interesting, something to be discovered, a lit to be uncovered; be coy about it
* Offer riches at a price: 
* Present a discovery: something interesting that isn't inherently or immediatly dangerous
* Point to a looming danger: claw-prints, howling, neat pile of sticks
* Introduce a danger, person, or faction
* Bar the way: they hit an obstacle or a dead end

#### Resolving Chart a Course

##### Requirements

If they are not addressed, tell them the consequences.  
Make soft moves against teh requirements.  
If they lose them, make them feel it.  

##### Presenting challenges

For each leg of journey, ask if this is a good place to introduce a challenge with a soft GM move.  
If someone gets a -6, drop them into the thick of it.  
Challanges may repeat themsleves becasue of poor descisions or dice rolls.  

##### "The way is perilous, filled with dangers"

Save it for truely dangerous legs of travel and destinations.  

#### Weather

Important.  
Colours the whole trip and can be a challenge all by itself.  

You can decide yourself based on the story or you can roll the Die of Fate.  

### PC moves

Have what you need:  
Recover:  
Struggle as one: when you make everyone Defy Danger  
Keep company: ask at a lul in the story, but don't overdo it; best when thy are coming back home  
Make camp: ask questions from the GM cheatsheet and decide what'll happen: show downsides, tell them the consequences or offer them opportunities at a cost  
Forage: travel-foraging halfs distance travelled; if danger isn't avoided, present it; if it was avoided, they find a plant or meat based product, maybe even let them decide  

#### Deprivation

If PCs don't get food, water and rest:
1) they don't get to make a choice when they go Make Camp
2) then they have to Defy Danger, hunger, thirst and exhaustion
3) then use GM moves or even write up a threat

### Going home

Gloss over the trip back home, ask questions and ask to Keep Company unless the PCs:
* bring something/someone back that makes the trip more difficult or dangerous
* are lost, badly injured, out of supplies or hunted
* are racing to get home before something bad happens
* return home by a different route, with new challenges and points of interest

In those cases, Chart a Course back to the Steading just like the initial journey.  

#### Arriving home

* Did they trigger any moves before they left that took time to resolve?  
* Did they Requisition town resources?  
    * If so, did they bring them back safely?  
* Did they Return Triumphant?  
* Did any of your threats advance towards their impending dooms?
* How will various NPCs react to the PC’s return?
    * How will the PC’s success or failure impact the town?
    * How will you show this to the PCs?

Return triumphant: feel this one out, but make sure PCs indeed return triumphant, that folks celebrate them or talk excitidly about it  

### What to prep

1) Chart a Course: make your choices with tick boxes, so you can tick them as you present them
2) Draw a map
3) Identify points of interest:
    * any landmarks
    * any places where you plan to have a scene
    * the journey's destination
4) Identify legs of journey between points of interest
5) Make notes about each point of interest or leg of journey:
    * brief description
    * 2-3 impressions
    * questions you want to ask PCs
    * any challenges from the Chart a Course
    * any dangers or discoveries
6) Prepare up to seven possible encounters: dangers, discoveries, events for when the PCs miss a roll on 7-9; make sure you tie these encounters into the greater story
