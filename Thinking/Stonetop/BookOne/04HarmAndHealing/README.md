## Harm and Healing

Types of harm:
* damage to HP
* debilities
* problematic wounds
* death or lethal wound

### Hit points and damage

HP definitely are not a measure of how injured or uninjured a character is.  
They're a combination of fighting spirit, determination, pluck, luck, and skill; the ability to turn what should be a lethal blow into a graze.  

#### Damage

Dealing damage should almost never be your move, but it will often be part of your move.  

If the damage isn't associated with a prepared danger:
* cause bruises and scrapes, pain, or light burns, it inflicts d4 damage.
* cause nasty flesh wounds, bruises, or burns, it inflicts d6 damage.
* break bones, cause deep/wide burns, or debilitate with pain, it inflicts d8 damage.
* cause death or dismemberment, it inflicts d10 damage.

#### Armour

#### Taking damage

#### Regaining hit points

A PC of follower regains HP when:
* they Recover
* they Make Camp, and choose to regain HP
* they're at Death's Door and roll a 10+
* they have a few days of downtime and Convalesce
* another move says that they do
* you offer them an opportunity to regain HP and they take it

### Debilities

When you are have a debility you roll with a disadvantage.  

Debilities:
* Weakened: the character is fatigued, tired, sluggish, shaky
* Dazed: the character is out of it, befuddled, not thinking clearly
* Miserable: the character is greatly distressed, grumpy or angry, unwell, in pain

### Problematic wounds

A problematic wound is one with lasting fictional consequences.  
Examples:
* A twisted ankle can't bear weight
* A blow to the head leaves them staggering and dizzy
* A severed hand is severed, and they're probably bleeding out

You can use them to justify the result on a 9- roll.  

#### How do you decide?

Align it with the flow of fiction.  
If you don't know what harm you want to inflict, let me damage roll inform you.  
Messy and forceful tagged attacks are especially destructive.  

### Death and dying

### Healing and recovery

#### Recover

#### Make Camp

#### Convalesce
