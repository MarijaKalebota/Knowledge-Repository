* dogs Bluebell, Jessie and Pincher
* cart-horses Boxer and Cloves
* white goat Muriel
* donkey Benjamin
* white mare Mollie
* raven Moses
Old Major holds a speech about how the lives of animals areare miserable, laborious and short, not because of the environment, but because the product of animal labor is stolen by humans who keep them barely fed.  
Old Major advocates a rebellion and the overthrow of the humans.  
Animals burst into song, the "Beasts of England".
