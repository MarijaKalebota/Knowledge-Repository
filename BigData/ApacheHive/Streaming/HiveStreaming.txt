## Hive Streaming

Allows data to be appended continously into Hive.


### Configuration

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest
https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/49949/test-7.html

In the "hive-site.xml" change the following configuration properties:

hive.txn.manager                = org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager
hive.compactor.initiator.on     = true
hive.compactor.worker.threads   = 1 (greater then 0)

hive.support.concurrency        = true
hive.enforce.bucketing          = true
hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode= nonstrict
hive.txn.timeout                = 300


### Additional considerations

A streaming table has to be configured as follows:
* has to be stored as ORC (syntax: "stored as orc")
* has to be transactional (syntax: "tblproperties("transactional"="true")")
* must be bucketed but not sorted (syntax: "clustered by (colName) into 10 buckets")
* the client user has to have permissions to write to the table and create partitions

Example:
 CREATE TABLE alarms (stamp TIMESTAMP, state STRING, status_code STRING, down TINYINT, type STRING, info STRING)
 CLUSTERED BY(stamp) INTO 10 BUCKETS
 STORED AS ORC
 tblproperties("transactional"="true");
