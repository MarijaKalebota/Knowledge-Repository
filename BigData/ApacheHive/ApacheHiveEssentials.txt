/your/path/to/hive/bin/hive
OR
/your/path/to/hive/bin/beeline

You can use an IDE.

### Data Definition and Description

Hive data types: primitive and complex.
Primitive: integer, float, double, binary, boolean, string, char, date, timestamp, ...
Complex: array, map, struct, ...

Hive Data Definition Language:

Database: collection of table;.
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] _name;
DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] _name [CASCADE]

Internal table: Hive table; data is alive as long as the table.
External table: data outside Hive; data lives even if the table is dropped; often preferred.
Can use Create Table As Select (CTAS).

Partition: scan only part of the table; faster queries.

Buckets: cluster databases; better performance.

View: logical structure; simplify queries.
