These configs override all other manually set configs.

On the "Services" tab a number of services can be selected. 
Upon selection each one has a "Summary" and "Configs" tab. (Note: some also have "Heatmaps") 
The "Configs" tab has "Settings" and "Advanced" tabs. 
In the "Advanced" tab a number of properties can be changed. (Note: not all properties are displayed)
If some properties are missing you can attempt to add them by opening one of the "Custom _conf_file" dropdowns
and clicking "Add Property ...".

In addition, you can change the config group by clicking on the "Manage Config Groups". There you can duplicate
the current settings and then change them. When done, you can assign a host to the appropriate settings group.
