cat acts as a filter.

> is a write to file operator.
Example: ls -l / > /tmp/test != ls -l /

>> is a append data to a file operator.

< is a sent file content to a program operator.
Example: cat < /ect/password

- represents stdin/stdout operator in commands.
example: wget -O - http://ftp.hr.debian.org/README

| is a pipe operator.
Example: ls -l /lib/ | head

ls -l /lib --- stdout ---> --- stdin ---> head ---> monitor

2> is an error output redirection operator.
Example: ls -l /lib1 2> /tmp/lib5

&> joint stderr and stdout redirection operator.
2>&1 redirect stderr to stdin operator.

locate is a much simpler find.
