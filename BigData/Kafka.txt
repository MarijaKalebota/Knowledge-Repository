Kafka is run as a cluster; stores streams of "records" in categories called "topics".

Producer: publish records to topics.
Consumer: subscribe to topics and process streams of records.
Streams: application as a stream processor; take input stream from topic and transform into an output stream which outputs to a topic.
Connector: connect topics to existing systems.
