### Maven project


##### Create a project

Create from File -> New... -> Maven -> ...
If you want, you can create an Archtype, a template project or you can just click Next.
Fill in both of these:
* groupId - creator's ID
* artifactId - JAR or project name


### Adding dependencies

You can add dependencies by simply copying the XML from the Maven Central Repository into the "pom.xml".
Sometimes it can be hard to find the right JAR in all of the many subfolders of an external project. You can
download the [JARExplorer](https://github.com/javalite/jar-explorer) to aid you in your search.


#### Build, plugins and packaging

You can package the project into a .jar by adding <packaging>jar</packaging> into "pom.xml".
To package the project, that is, execute the Maven goal "mvn package" you can open the Maven project view. Click
on the icon in the bottom left corner of the window.
Plugins can range from utilities, to those that allow you to execute the project from the command line like
"exec-maven-plugin".


#### Deployment

If you want to transfer the project, package the whole project into a .zip or something similar and install it
with "mvn install".
If you have the "exec-maven-plugin", you can execute the project from the command line with "mvn exec:java".
