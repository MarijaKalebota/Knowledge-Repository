Introducing the Knowledge Repository
====================================

Knowledge Repository is a collection of text documents and programs I wrote to remind myself and can teach others about software engineering. Software engineering is a broad subject which is why the Knowledge Repository is subdivided into folders according to topics they cover.
Inspiration file is a list of topics and materials with which the Knowledge Repository will be expanded.

Empty or unfinished folders are marked with a suffix -TODO.

Each subfolder has its own README which explains what it is and what it contains.

Intention
---------

As time passes by, I will forget what I once knew and even worse, I will forget how I came to knew these things in the first place. To combat this reality, I have decided to create a digital booklet of booklets with which I will be able to remind myself about the thing I knew. I know that writing the booklet will pay off ten years from now...
