# Knowledge Repository

Knowledge Repository is a collection of reference sheets, book summaries and programs about software
engineering. Software engineering is a broad subject which is why the Knowledge Repository is subdivided into
folders. Each folder covers a single topic or is further subdivided. Each folder has its own README which
explains the topic and its contents. Empty or unfinished folders are marked with a -TODO suffix.


### Inspiration

Inspiration text file contains a list of topics and materials with which the Knowledge Repository may be
expanded in the future. The topics are not ordered.

### Intention

As time elapses, I will forget what I knew and even worse, I will forget how I came to know what I forgot.
To combat this reality, I have decided to create a this digital booklet of booklets, hoping it will keep
forgetfulness at bay. Somehow... I know that writing this booklet will pay off ten years from now...
