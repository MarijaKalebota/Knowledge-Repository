## Python 2.x

Python is an interpreted language that uses indents as an end of statement symbol and uses duck typing that
doesn't require users to write a formal data declaration. Because Python uses an interpreter the program's
source code cannot be hidden because the executable program and the source code are one and the same. Python
has thousands of well documented libraries.

### Python specific folders

- Decorators: a function that intercepts another function; used for caching results and returning the cache
instead of executing a costly function

- Generators: distinguished by a yield keyword upon whose execution the generator stops and then later resumes
from that point when invoked again; behaves like an iterable object such as a list

- LambdaFunctions: also known as anonymous functions, they are a single expression that could be written in a
return statement
