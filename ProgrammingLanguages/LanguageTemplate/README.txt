Language Template
=================

Language Template is a template that partitions programs according to topics. Each folder can have a README that serves as an introduction to the language features, programs or tools stored in the same folder.

-ObjectOriented: teaches the basic principles of classes, objects, methods, attributes, inheritance (is a), composition (has a), how objects communicate

-Setup: teaches what to install in order to get the simplest possible program running

-Testing: teaches the concept of automated unit testing, shows tools that make tests independent

Language specific folders
-----------------------

Some languages can have additional folders which cannot be found in the list above. That is because some languages have special features that deserve to be covered.
