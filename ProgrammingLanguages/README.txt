Programming Languages
=====================

Programming Languages contains a folder for each language I have researched extensively. Language folders are created from the Language Template folder. The Language Template has empty subfolders named after common language features which are then populated with README and program files.
Language folders serve as a reference guide, cheat sheet or a demonstration of what the syntax does.
All programs are written in the following style:
<explanation_of_the_statement_below>
<programming_language_statement> <single_comment_sign> -> <result_of_statement_execution>
