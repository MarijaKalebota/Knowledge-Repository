Merge sort

==========



Merge sort is a recursive sort which divides the data structure into atoms, elements and then merges them together swapping elements before merging so that the merged concatenation is always ordered. Its speed is always O(nlogn).
Sorting begins by dividing an array into two part, left and right. The division is executed by modifying the low and high barriers which hold a number corresponding with the position in the array.
