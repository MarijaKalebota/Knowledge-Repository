Knowledge Repository
====================

Knowledge Repository is a collection of reference sheets, book summaries and programs about software engineering. Software engineering is a broad subject which is why the Knowledge Repository is subdivided into folders. Each folder covers a single topic or it is in itself subdivided.
Each subfolder has its own README which explains what it is and what it contains. Empty or unfinished folders are marked with a suffix -TODO.
Inspiration text file contains a list of topics and materials with which the Knowledge Repository will be expanded.

Intention
---------
As time elapses, I will forget what I knew and even worse, I will forget how I came to know what I forgot. To combat this reality, I have decided to create a digital booklet of booklets, hoping it will keep my forgetfulness at bay. Somehow... I know that writing the booklet will pay off ten years from now...
