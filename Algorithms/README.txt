Algorithms
==========

An algorithm is a set of instructions. As simple as that. Very useful algorithms are divided into categories and given names based on what they do and so there are search algorithms, sorting algorithms and many others.
Algorithms in this folder are written is Java, but before they were compiled they were constructed and written on a piece of paper.

Search algorithms
-----------------
Search algorithms are made for finding data in data structures, very often lists, but it could also be (binary) trees and other structures. There are two main search algorithms: linear search and binary search.

Sorting algorithms
------------------
Sorting algorithms order data. Data can be ordered ascending or descending, in data structures or in files. Quickly sorting large amounts of data is a common problem and therefor many sorting algorithms have been developed. From slowest to quickest, here are a few sorting algorithms: insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort.
