## Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions. As simple as that. Very useful algorithms are divided into categories
and given names based on what they do or how they behave. There are search algorithms, sorting algorithms and
many others. Algorithms in this folder are written is Java, but before they were compiled they were constructed
and tested on a piece of paper.

### Search algorithms

Search algorithms are used for finding data in data structures, very often lists, but they could also be
(binary) trees and other structures. There are two main search algorithms: linear search and binary search.

### Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms order data. Data can be ordered ascending or descending, in data structures or in files.
Quickly sorting large amounts of data is a common problem and therefor many sorting algorithms have been
developed. From slowest to quickest, here are a few well known sorting algorithms: insertion sort,
merge sort and quick sort.
